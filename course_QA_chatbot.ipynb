\\nThe advent of Tableau democratized this process \\nand allowed B I analysts to be \\nindependent non-technical people can easily \\nload data into the program and start playing \\nwith it. \\nTableau's forte are meaningful intuitive \\nvisualizations and sometimes that's really \\nvaluable analysts are able to explore their \\ndata right away without spending too much time \\non numbers which provide limited insights and \\ninstead focus on data that matters. \\nThis is why we can confidently say that Tableau \\nis an indispensable tool in the arsenal of most \\ncorporate business intelligence analysts, \\ndata analysts and data scientists. \\nMany people are uncertain about the difference \\nbetween Tableau and spreadsheet tools \\nlike Excel. \\nAnd that's a reasonable doubt until we point \\nout they serve different purposes using \\ntableaux doesn't necessarily mean you can \\nforget about Excel and vice versa while Excel \\nis not as powerful or \\nintuitive as tableau. \\nWhen it comes to data visualization, \\ntableau is not optimal when you would like to \\nuse it as a data creation tool. \\nAlthough it has several database management \\nfunctionalities, the program isn't the best \\nsolution when you would like to perform \\nmultiple operations with your data before you \\nstart analyzing it. \\nMoreover, tableau isn't great for multilayered \\ncalculations. \\nIt is able to calculate in its own fields, but \\nit shouldn't be used as a spreadsheet tool for \\nmultilayered calculations such as the \\npreparation of a budget in Excel where tableaux \\nsurpasses the competition is in data \\nvisualizations. \\nIt is a very smart program that allows you to \\nvisualize data in a more powerful way compared \\nto Excel. \\nSo for example, when you work with geographical \\ndata, there is no way Excel could interpret the \\ncells in your spreadsheet as a geographical \\nlocation. \\nOn the other hand, Tableau recognizes that and \\nallows you to visualize such data and see how a \\nvariable is distributed geographically. \\nMoreover, tableaux allows you to combine \\nseveral types of charts and build up meaningful \\ndashboards that are truly interactive and \\nfacilitate additional analysis. \\nOnce you visualize your data, you can easily \\ndig deeper and explore its granularity, \\nfinding the reason for unusual spikes or \\ninvestigating certain trends. \\nEven novice tableau users would be able to save \\na significant amount of time if they transfer \\ntheir pre designed existing Excel dashboards to \\ntableau uploading new data and \\nupdating visuals is more rapid in Tableau. \\nTherefore, we can agree that a competent \\nanalyst needs both Excel and tableaux. \\nGiven that they serve different purposes. \\nTableau is superior when it comes to visuals \\nand dashboards and Excel is a spreadsheet \\ntool we need in order to perform multilayered \\ncalculations in the same way, \\na combat soldier carries a rifle and a pistol \\nat the same time and uses them under different \\ncircumstances. \\nA business analyst should know how to work with \\nboth Excel and tableaux and apply each of them \\nwhen needed. \\n## Let's download Tableau Public \\nOk, guys, it is time to get started with \\nTableaux. \\nLet's type Tableau public in Google. \\nAs you can see the first result, we have points \\nto Tableau's website at www \\ndot tableau dot com. \\nI'll click on the link and this will direct me \\nto the Tableau public Domain. \\nIt shouldn't be too difficult to download \\nTableau from here if you are wondering why we \\nsearched for Tableau public. \\nThe reason is quite trivial. \\nThis is Tableau's free version if you don't \\nhave a paid subscription for Tableaux. \\nThis is an excellent alternative. \\nYou can practice with most of the program's \\nfunctionalities and you don't have to pay \\nTableau's annual fee. \\nSo it is up to you. \\nYou can either use Tableau public for free or \\npay for Tableau's desktop version. \\nBoth options would allow you to follow along. \\nThere are some issues when you want to \\nintegrate Tableau public and programming \\nlanguages like R, Python and SQL to do that, \\nyou'll need Tableau \\ndesktop. \\nBut for now, Tableau public will do just fine \\nand allow us to practice at will all I have to \\ndo here is provide an email address. \\nAnd once I have done that, an exe file will \\ndownload automatically on my computer. \\nLet's open the EC file. \\nThis is the standard installation procedure you \\nwill find when installing any program out there. \\nI have to agree to Tableau's terms and \\nconditions and then click install. \\nOnce the installation starts, I simply have to \\nwait. \\nAnd here we are, Tableau is installed on my PC. \\nWe are ready to start our journey. \\n \\n## Connecting data in Tableau \\nRight. Great. \\nHere is our freshly installed version of \\nTableaux. \\nI am sure you are anxious to create some \\nfascinating visualizations. \\nSo let's get started. \\nFirst off, we need to learn how to connect \\nTableau to the data source we will be working \\nwith. \\nThere are two options, we can either create a \\nconnection to a file or a server. \\nOf course, \\nwe'll choose one of the two depending on where \\nthe data is. \\nLet's connect Tableau to a Microsoft Excel file \\nin general. \\nEvery time we use a source file in one of the \\nlectures, you will be able to find it in the \\nsupplemental resources section. \\nJust open your course curriculum and download \\nthe available files for that lesson. \\nSee, OK, great. \\nI'll select the file called GDP data and under \\nconnections. \\nI can now see that Tableau opened the file. \\nOur source has three sheets, data, metadata, \\ncountries and \\nmetadata indicators. \\nWhat we usually have to do is choose the \\nworksheet we'll need and drag into the upper \\npart of the screen where drag sheets here is \\nwritten. \\nOnce we do that tableaux is going to activate \\nthe sheet we selected and provide us with a \\npreview of the data we have inside the first \\ntwo rows of the sheet are empty. \\nAnd hence, we see all of these null values \\ntableaux is really smart \\nand can often help us with similar issues. \\nAs you can see here, the program suggests using \\nits data interpreter functionality \\nto clean the data. \\nAll right, let's do that. \\nAnd voila the first two rows containing no \\nvalues disappeared. \\nThat's awesome. \\nIn our next video, we'll open our first tableau \\nworksheet and I'll be happy to introduce you to \\nits structure. \\nThis will do for now. \\nThanks for watching. \\n \\n## Exploring Tableau's interface \\nSo we've already connected our file to tableaux. \\nNow, in this lesson, we'll be creating our \\nfirst sheet. \\nIt's really easy to do and resembles how we \\ncreate a sheet in Excel or pretty much \\nevery other spreadsheet software. \\nAll I have to do is click here and a new sheet \\nwill be created, right? \\nThis is what a Tableau sheet looks like. \\nWe can have as many of them as we want. \\nI can simply click on this little icon at the \\nbottom and a new worksheet is added. \\nThe other two icons which are next to it are \\nfor creating a new dashboard and a new \\nstory. \\nWe'll deal with dashboards further in the \\ncourse. \\nSo we won't use these buttons for now. \\nOK. \\nLet's give some structure to what you are \\nseeing here. \\nIf this software is new to you, \\nthings can be a bit confusing. \\nSo it will be best if we spend a few minutes. \\nThe remainder of this lesson talking you \\nthrough Tableau's interface. \\nFirst off, we have 10 different tabs on \\nTableau's default ribbon. \\nThese are file data worksheet dashboard, \\nstory analysis map format window \\nand help. \\nLet's quickly go through each of them. \\nAs with most programs, the file tab contains \\ncertain functionalities related to opening, \\nclosing and saving files if you would like to, \\nyou can also exit tableau from here. \\nBut why would you want to do that data? \\nOn the other hand is where you will find \\nfunctionalities related to the data source you \\nare using here, \\nyou can add a new data connection, replace an \\nexisting one or simply edit the data \\nsource of the worksheet you are working with. \\nNext, we have the worksheet tab. \\nIt can be helpful when we want to create a new \\nworksheet hide or show a charts, \\ntitle caption summary and so on. \\nI am sure you noticed that we already created a \\nnew sheet with the little icon we have at the \\nbottom left corner of the sheet and we can do \\nthe same thing from the worksheet tab as well. \\nSuch repetition is common for most programs, \\nfunctionalities available in the ribbon \\ncan be accessed in other ways too. \\nIn fact, I rarely use the ribbon \\nfunctionalities, but it is good to have an \\noverview and be aware that they are there. \\nOK? \\nNext, we have the dashboard and story tabs. \\nAs I said, we'll learn more about dashboards \\nand stories later on. \\nIn the course, the analysis tab is where you \\ncan tweak your visualization in terms of \\nlabels, show figures as a percentage of the \\ntotal add trend lines, \\nlegends filters and more. \\nWe'll explore many of these options later in \\nthe course for now, \\nyou can remember that here, we have some \\ninteresting functionalities related to the way \\nwe perform our analysis. \\nAnd some of the tools we'll incorporate in it \\nmap is a tab that is helpful when we use \\nTableau's geographic visualization capabilities. \\nPretty soon. \\nYou will see that this is one of the most \\npowerful and impressive tableau features. \\nOf course, format can help us adjust the way \\nour visualization appears from here. \\nWe can modify its font, font size, axis, \\nbackgrounds, \\nlabels, size and so much more. \\nThat's another tab containing plenty of useful \\nfunctionalities. \\nWe'll explore later windows and help are two of \\nthe standard tabs we find in most \\nprograms. \\nSo I am not going to spend much time on them \\nalso because we are not going to use them \\nthroughout the course. \\nHowever, one thing we should mention is that \\nTableau public has a nice and open community of \\nusers who will be able to help you and whose \\nwork you can look at if needed, \\nall users of Tableau public who save their work, \\nmake it publicly available. \\nTherefore, this can be a useful place where you \\ncan search for a given issue you need help with \\nand see what comes up. \\nSo if I click on community and search for \\ngeography, I'll be able to see the \\nwork other users have saved previously, right? \\nThis is Tableau's ribbon \\nbelow the ribbon, we have several buttons that \\ncan be quite helpful. \\nThe show start page button takes us to the \\nscreen we saw previously when we connected \\ntableaux and our GDP data Excel file to get \\nback to the sheet that was created earlier. \\nI'll click here. \\nI'm sure you know how to work with undo and \\nredo. \\nSo if I were to drag one of the fields here, I \\ncan go back and undo this section with \\nundo. \\nOf course, see undone. \\nMost of the typical windows shortcuts can be \\nused here as well as you probably know. \\nThe shortcut for undo is control Z. \\nOn the right, we have other useful buttons such \\nas save, \\nallowing you to save the progress of your work. \\nQuite intuitively. \\nNew data source opens the connect functionality \\nwe saw earlier. \\nThe other buttons we have here are new \\nworksheet, clears, \\nsheet swap rows and columns, sort and so on. \\nWe'll explore many of these throughout the \\ncourse for now, \\nit would be best if you simply gain an idea how \\nvarious objects are positioned within Tableau's \\ninterface. OK. \\nOn the left side of Tableau's screen, \\nwe have two pas data and analytics. \\nThe data pane is quite important. \\nIt shows us what data we've loaded and then \\nTableau classifies the data into two \\ntypes dimensions and measures to put it \\nslightly differently. \\nThis is a distinction between categorical and \\nnumerical data. \\nThe data in the dimensions field cannot be \\naggregated. \\nIt is qualitative in nature. \\nQuite the opposite measures can be aggregated \\nand are quantitative in nature. \\nIn the next few lessons, we'll learn how to \\nwork with these fields. \\nBut for now, it would be nice if I just show \\nyou that we can drag dimensions and measures \\ninto the work area and use them to create our \\nvisualizations there. \\nThe work area is where we'll create our \\nvisualizations, dashboards and stories and \\nthis is one way to create a chart. \\nI am sure you noticed that the columns and rows, \\npart of the sheet started showing us the \\nvariables we've added to the workspace area. \\nWe'll explore this part of the interface in a \\nseparate video in a few lessons. \\nOK. Perfect. \\nWhat else do we have the show me button on the \\nright, which allows us to adjust the type of \\nvisualization we use. \\nIt is a very cool feature because tableau tells \\nus what types of visualizations we can \\nchoose from as not all charts will be available \\ndepending on the data we have chosen to work \\nwith. \\nOnce we decide we would like to switch to a \\ndifferent chart, all we need to do is select \\nthe respective type of chart and tableau makes \\nthe adjustment for us neat, right? \\nAnd finally, here in the middle, we have three \\nimportant sections, \\npages, filters and marks the pages shelf. \\nLets you \\nbreak a view into a series of pages. \\nSo you can better analyze how a specific field \\naffects the rest of the data in a view we'll \\nuse the filter shelf when working with \\nfilters and filtering our data. \\nThe marks shelf on the other hand contains \\nfunctionalities related to coloring size \\nlabels and so on. \\nThis lesson was a quick overview of Tableau's \\ninterface. \\nI am sure now you have a better idea of what \\nyou see in front of you. \\nWhen you open the program in the lessons to \\ncome, we'll continue to explore Tableau's \\nfunctionalities and you'll learn a ton about \\neach of the buttons we mentioned here as of now, \\nthis will do. \\nThanks for watching. \\n## Let's create our first chart in Tableau! \\nAll right, excellent. \\nIt is time to continue our adventure in \\nTableaux. \\nIn this lesson, we'll create our first \\nvisualization and it is going to be awesome \\nready. \\nLet's get right into it. \\nThen as you can see the workspace area is empty \\nright now, \\nwe've already loaded the GDP data file and we \\ncan see that here. \\nActually, let's open the GDP data XL file for a \\nsecond. \\nI want to make sure you are familiar with its \\nstructure here. \\nIt is we have a few blank rows but tableau took \\ncare of them. \\nThen we have a column with country names, a \\ncolumn indicating that this is \\nGDP data and several columns with GDP figures \\nfor each of these \\ncountries. \\nAnd this is the data sheet we are using right \\nnow. Perfect. \\nLet's go back to tableaux. \\nThe way data is organized here is rather \\ninteresting. \\nOur attention should be focused on the \\ndimensions and measures part of the screen. \\nFirst off, we notice that tableau has been very \\nsmart and managed to organize our \\ndata. \\nCategorical variables are right here under \\ndimensions. \\nWhile numerical data such as the country's \\nactual GDP is under measures dimensions have \\nbeen colored in blue \\nand measures are in green. OK. \\nAnother important remark we have to make is \\nthat some of the fields we see here are in \\nitalics and others aren't the distinction \\nbetween the two is that tableau generates \\ncertain fields based on the data. \\nIt finds when tableau generates its own fields \\nsuch as the measure names field we see here. \\nThese are fields that are not contained in \\nour original data source, But tableaux deems \\nthat these can be useful and creates \\nthem for us. \\nThe same thing is true for latitude, \\nlongitude, number of records and measure values \\nwe see in green \\nunder measures. \\nThe rest of the fields written without italics \\nare ones we saw in the XL file. \\nWe loaded country name, indicator name and the \\nyears from 2002 to \\n2016 where we have country's GDP figures. Good. \\nAnother important detail I would like to \\nmention is that tableaux adds an icon right \\nnext to each of the fields we have under \\ndimensions and measures. \\nThis is what allows us to understand how \\ntableau reads the data. \\nThe first field under dimensions is country \\nname and its icon is the \\nglobe. \\nTableau recognizes that this field is related \\nto actual countries and it is ready to help us \\nout when we need to visualize such data. \\nIf I click on the icon, I'll be able to see \\nthat this is a string and that its \\ngeographic role is of country region as it \\nshould be. \\nAt the same time, the tiny ABC icon of the \\nindicator name field shows us that \\nthis is a text value. \\nAnd in fact, when I click on it, I can see that \\nthis is a string but different to what we have \\nfor the country name field. \\nThe geographic role of indicator name is none. \\nThat's because this is purely a text value. \\nWhat about the year measures we have below? \\nWell, these are numerical values, right? \\nTherefore, it comes as no surprise that when we \\nclick on their icon, \\ndesignating numerical values, we will see these \\nare numbers. \\nOK? Perfect. \\nLet's do the following. \\nI'll drag the country name field into the \\nworkspace area and boom \\nTableau created a world map that shows us the \\nlocation of each of the countries we have in \\nour data source. \\nIt is quite interesting to see that the field \\nwe see under columns and rows isn't country \\nname but are artificially generated longitude \\nand latitude fields. \\nAt first, it may seem strange but then when you \\nthink about it, \\nit is intuitive. \\nTableau understands country name is a \\ngeographical field. \\nThis is why it will do much more than simply \\ncreate a row or a column containing a list of \\nthe country we have in the Excel file. \\nNo, the program is smarter than that. \\nIt reads the country names and then creates the \\ntwo fields, \\nlongitude and latitude in order to map each \\ncountry geographically and hence the \\nbeautiful map we have here. \\nNow, if I drag the year 2016 in the map, \\ntableau will update the \\nchart adding the 2016 GDP of each country. \\nWe can see that happen. \\nIf we hover above each of the dots we have \\nrepresenting the countries on our map. \\nSee the US GDP for 2016 was more than $18 \\ntrillion while Canada's GDP was around $1.5 \\ntrillion. \\nOK. Perfect. \\nEverything's good. \\nOur first visualization and Tableau is almost \\nready. \\nOne last finishing touch I would like to add is \\nto enlarge the bubbles a bit indicating how \\nlarge a country's GDP is to \\ndo that. \\nI can work with the newly appeared sum 2016 pan \\non the right side of the screen, I'll click on \\nits tiny arrow and we'll select \\nedit sizes, the edit sizes, dialog box allows \\nme to enlarge the bubbles we see in \\nthe visualization. \\nI think this will do let's click apply. \\nAnd as you see the bubbles in the visualization \\nincreased. \\nThis makes it a bit easier to compare the GDP \\nof different countries. \\nThe final touch will be to edit the name of \\nthis visualization. \\nI'll double click here and simply type a title. \\nAnything is better than sheet one. \\nThat's why I'll simply type GDP per country \\ncomparison. \\nAnd here we are, that's our first visualization \\nin Tableau and we are just getting \\nstarted \\n \\n# Tableau Functionalities \\n## Creating a table \\nOk, perfect. \\nIn this lesson, we'll continue exploring some \\nof Tableau's main features in particular, we'll \\nlearn how to create a table with data \\nand add some custom fields. \\nThe table we will create is going to be a \\npretty simple one, \\nproviding a monthly and yearly breakdown of a \\ncompany's sales. \\nAs you can see, our original data source \\ncontains a column called period. \\nThis is where we have both yearly and monthly \\ndata. \\nThe first four characters designate the year \\nwhen a sale was made and then the last two \\ncontain information about the month when the \\nsale occurred. \\nWhat I would like to do is split this \\ninformation into two separate custom fields, \\nyear and month. \\nThe way to do that is to go to the analysis tab \\nand create a calculated field, \\nright? \\nOnce this dialog box opens, I'll type the name \\nof the field I am creating which is year. \\nThen I'll use the left function in order to \\ntake the four leftmost symbols of \\nthe period field. \\nThis is where we have the year when the sale \\noccurred. \\nLeft is a function. \\nMost of you are probably familiar with in \\nTableau. \\nIt works in the exact same way as it does. \\nIn Excel. \\nFor example, in our next lesson, we'll pay \\nextra attention to the different types of \\noperations you can do to create custom fields. \\nOK? \\nTableau recognizes we are writing the left \\nfunction and it helps us with autocomplete \\nsuggestions. \\nThe left function needs two arguments from us a \\nstring which in this case \\nis the period field we have in our source sheet. \\nIt is important to make sure that the period \\nfield, data type is a string otherwise \\ntableau will show an error. \\nSo I'll type period. \\nAnd as I do that, tableau manages to recognize \\nI'm referring to the period field and \\nallows me to select it right away. \\nThe second component of the formula is the \\nnumber of characters we would like to extract, \\nwe'll need four characters and that's what I'll \\nwrite here, \\nclose the brackets and our new field is ready. \\nIf the period field was not of the string type, \\nwe would have had problems because \\nleft is a function that requires us to use \\nstrings, I'll change the data type of the \\nperiod field. \\nAnd as soon as I do tableaux shows us a warning \\nsign next to the newly generated field year. \\nAnd it doesn't allow us to drag this field into \\nthe workspace area. \\nBasically, we can't use it. OK. \\nI'll change the type of data of the period \\nfield back to string and the issue will be \\nresolved. \\nNow, I can easily drag the year field into the \\nworkspace area. \\nSee, perfect. \\nThe other field I would like to create is month. \\nAnd in order to do that, \\nI'll use the right function again, we'll need \\nto go to analysis and create a calculated \\nfield. \\nFirst, we'll assign it with a name months and \\nthen I'll type in the right function following \\nthe exact same procedure as before \\nthe string we'll need is the same period. \\nand the number of characters we'll need is two, \\ngiven that months are the two \\nrightmost characters within the period field. \\nExcellent. \\nNow that we have our second field months, \\nlet's add it right next to years in the \\nworkspace area. \\nI can do that in two ways. \\nI can either drag the field into the workspace \\narea and place it right next to the year's \\ninformation or alternatively drag the month \\nfield right next to the year's field in the \\nrows. \\nPart of the screen, the output is the same. \\nNow, we should create a new calculated field \\nand name it number of \\nrecords in the box below. \\nWe will just type the number one and press. \\nOK? \\nThis field represents a simple count of the \\nrows we have in our source data. \\nOK? Great. \\nWe've managed to create a nice table that \\ngroups all 12 months of 2016 and \\nall 12 months of 2017. \\nI'll simply insert the number of records field \\nwe just created and voil. \\nThis is a nice table that shows us the \\nbreakdown of the company's total number of \\nsales for each month in 2016 and 2017. Awesome. \\nRight. \\n## Creating custom fields \\nWe already know how to create custom fields. \\nWe did it two times in our previous lesson, \\ncreating the years and months fields. \\nIn this lesson, \\nwe'll spend some time describing some of the \\nother ways you can transform your source data \\nand create custom fields. \\nRemember, we shouldn't go too far with these as \\nTableau's main purpose is visualization and not \\ndata creation or modeling. \\nHowever, sometimes it can be really handy to \\nperform certain manipulations once we've loaded \\nour data into tableaux and we need a certain \\ntype of analysis. \\nOK. \\nHere we go. \\nThe typical Tableau operators you'll need to \\nremember are plus for addition, \\nminus for subtraction star for multiplication \\nforward slash for division \\nand carat for elevation alongside these, you'll \\nprobably need comparison operators \\nsuch as equal, higher, then lower than higher \\nor \\nequal and different. \\nThen the logical functions available in Tableau \\nare like the ones we have in Excel and or and \\nnot a lot of the \\nfunctions and symbols used in Excel can be used \\nwhen creating a calculated field. \\nSo for example, some of the most commonly used \\nfunctions are some for some \\naverage for average min and max allowing you to \\nfind the minimum and maximum \\nvalues within a range. \\nAnd A BS returning the absolute value of a \\nnumber. \\nAnd we already saw the text functions left and \\nright. \\nThey allow us to extract a leftmost and a right. \\nMost number of characters within a string we've \\nspecified besides left and right. \\nWe can also use the typical text functions \\navailable in Excel Mid providing us characters \\nthat are in the middle of a text string, upper \\nand lower allowing us to either convert it to \\nall upper case characters or convert it to all \\nlower case characters. \\nThis was a nice recap of the types of operators \\nwe can use in order to create custom fields in \\ntableaux. \\nFor more information on this topic, \\nwe'll add a downloadable file attached to this \\nlesson. \\nThanks for watching. \\n## Creating a custom field and adding calculations to a table \\nRight. \\nSo we are ready to go back to Tableaux and \\nperform a few additional operations with the \\ntable we created earlier right now. \\nIt shows us the number of units sold by the \\nfirm in each month of 2016 and 2017. \\nLet's change this measure. \\nWhat I would like it to show us is the revenue \\nthe company generated during each of these \\nperiods. \\nHow can I do that? \\nWell, it's fairly easy. \\nOur source data contains information about \\nprice and tableaux counted. \\nThe number of units sold each row shows us a \\nsingle car sale, right? \\nTherefore, if we multiply the price field and \\nthe auto generated number of records \\nfield, we would obtain revenues. \\nDo you agree? \\nOk, good. \\nLet's do that. \\nWe already know how to create a calculated \\nfield. \\nI'll name it revenue and we'll take advantage \\nof Tableau's autocomplete suggestions by \\nmultiplying price and number of records. \\nSee as we said in our previous lesson, we can \\nuse the star operator to carry out a \\nmultiplication. \\nOne very useful feature you have probably \\nnoticed is that at the bottom of the screen \\ntableau tells us whether the calculation we've \\nentered is a valid one or not. \\nRight now, my calculation is valid if I remove \\na few symbols tableau would indicate \\nthat the calculation contains errors. \\nThis is a good guiding light when we create a \\ncalculation, right. \\nSo this is our revenue field, \\nwe can easily substitute the number of records \\ndata in the table with it. \\nAll I have to do is drag the revenue field and \\nposition it over the number of records data \\ntableau replaces the two fields. Perfect. \\nAn important metric contained in our source \\ndata is gross profit. \\nBy definition, revenue minus cogs equals gross \\nprofit. \\nCurrently, we have revenue and gross profit. \\nLet's calculate cogs as the difference between \\nthe two. \\nThat's easy to do. \\nAll we have to do is use the minus operator. \\nNice. \\nLet's order our table in the following way. \\nFirst we'll have revenue then cogs and finally \\ngross profit. \\nI can do that by dragging and dropping the \\nthree fields within the table. \\nPlease note that their values appear in the \\nmeasure values card on the left side of the \\nworkspace area, we can change their order \\neither from here or directly inside the table. \\nIt's up to you. \\nOne more thing you have probably noticed the \\nmeasure names field which appeared in the \\ncolumns section. \\nThis is an auto generated field tableau uses in \\norder to form our table and separate the \\nnames of different measures. \\nIf we were to remove it from the column section, \\nthe table will lose its shape and all three \\nmeasures will be put together. \\nLet's press control and Z and undo this action. \\nOK. Excellent. \\nIn our next lesson, we'll learn how to add \\ntotals and subtotals to our tables in tableaux. \\nThis will do for now. \\nThanks for watching. \\n \\n## Adding totals and subtotals \\nMost executives and by most, I mean, all of \\nthem prefer receiving tables that contain \\ntotals and subtotals. \\nThis makes it easier for them and helps them \\ndigest information in a faster way. \\nIn this lesson, we will learn how to add totals \\nand subtotals to our tableau tables. \\nThat's nice because the table we have been \\nworking on in the last few videos doesn't \\ncontain totals for 2016 and 2017. \\nWe'll add them in this video. \\nThat's fairly easy to do. \\nI'll go to analysis then totals and we'll \\nselect show column, \\ngrand totals. \\nThe totals we just added are for the entire \\nperiod 2016 and 2017. \\nThat's not really useful. \\nIs it whenever a person is interested in a \\ncompany's sales or gross profit, they want to \\nknow how much it made in a specific year and \\nwhether it performed better than the year \\nbefore a company will also want to know how its \\nyear's sales compare to other companies. \\nSo I'll go to analysis totals and unclick the \\nshow column, grand totals to remove the total. \\nWe just added what I can do differently. \\nThe second time around is opt for add all \\nsubtotals. \\nAnd this will give me the total figures for \\n2016 and 2017 \\nseparately. \\nQuite nice. \\nRight now, we can read the table easily the \\nfictitious numbers we see here, \\nhelp us compare 2016 and 2017 and give us a \\ngood idea of what the \\nactual sales were for that period. \\nIn our next lesson, we'll add percentage, gross \\nmargin to our table. \\nThanks for watching. \\n \\n## Adding a custom calculation \\nOk, excellent. \\nWe're doing good. \\nWe've seen quite a few interesting tableau \\ntools so far and we'll continue to do so during \\nthis lesson as well. \\nOur table is almost ready. \\nWe have revenue cogs and gross profit. \\nNow that I think about it, one thing we should \\nprobably add is a gross margin calculation \\nright next to the gross profit figures. \\nGross margin is useful because it allows us to \\nsee what portion of revenues were converted \\ninto gross profit once we have considered the \\ncost of goods sold. \\nRight. \\nLet's add a new calculated field. \\nI'll name it GM percent. \\nAll we have to do is divide gross profits by \\nrevenue, right? \\nAnd we already know how to do that. Ok. \\nHere we are. \\nWe've calculated a new field. \\nLet's add it to the table. \\nI'll insert it in the measure values card there. \\nI've added the new field right next to gross \\nprofit. \\nBut it looks strange, doesn't it? \\nIf we divide gross profit by revenues, we would \\nusually expect a number in the region of 10, \\n2030 or maybe 50%. \\nCertainly not 1000. \\nWhat is going on here when I divide 71 million \\nby 244 million, \\nwhich is what we have in January. \\nI obtain 29%. \\nApproximately. \\nThere are two possible explanations. \\nEither tableau miscalculated, the simple \\ndivision we asked it to perform or our formula \\nis not 100%. OK. \\nIt's most likely us and not the computer, right. \\nI'll take out the GM percent field from the \\nmeasure values box and we'll edit the \\ncalculated field from here. \\nWhat we forgot to do is type sum around the two \\nvariables. \\nIf we don't sum the variables, we are not \\ndividing their total figures for each month. \\nLet's adjust our calculated field in this way \\nand see what happens. \\nOK? \\nThis is a column with numbers that look like \\nzeros, but perhaps these are percentage values. \\nLet's change the way the GM percent \\ncolumn is displayed to do that. \\nI'll simply click on the GM percent variable in \\nthe measure values card and select the format \\noption. \\nWe have quite a few options available here. \\nSo I'll simply select a percentage format with \\none decimal place. \\nVoila. \\nOur table is ready in our next lesson. \\nWe'll add a filter that would allow us to \\nchoose whether to see both 2016 and 2017 \\nvalues or just one at a time. \\nSee you there. \\n \\n## Inserting a filter \\nOne of the most interesting options available \\nin tableaux is adding a filter to the \\nvisualization you are working on in this lesson, \\nwe'll learn how to do that. \\nOf course, we'll add a filter to our table from \\na user standpoint. \\nThe only field which makes sense to be filtered \\nin this table is the year field. \\nA person could be interested in seeing numbers \\nfor 2016 or 2017 \\nonly. \\nFor example. \\nSo what I'll do is select the analysis tab and \\nthen select filters, \\nchoosing the year field. \\nAs we had already decided, \\nwe would like to create a filter for years. \\nAnd as we do that, a filter appears on the \\nright side of our workspace area. \\nNow, we can easily hide 2017. \\nFor example, I'll simply untick its \\nvalue and everything related to 2017 disappears \\nfrom the sheet \\npretty cool. \\nRight? \\nOf course, we can do the same with 2016. \\nI'll select 2017 and unti 2016. \\nAnd here we are. \\nWhen we click on the tiny arrow which is in the \\nupper right corner of the filter pane, \\nwe find plenty of options that allow us to \\nadjust the filter we've created. \\nFor example, we can change its appearance to \\nsingle value list, \\nrepresenting radio buttons have a filter as a \\ndrop down menu, \\na multiple values list and so on and so forth. \\nWe can easily change the filters formatting by \\nselecting format filters. \\nOr alternatively, we change the filters title \\nby clicking on the edit title button. \\nWhat else can we do? \\nOh, yes. \\nWe can choose whether to apply the filter to \\nthe current working sheet only or to all \\nworksheets in the tableau file we are working \\nwith. \\nAnd that's really useful when working with \\nseveral interrelated sheets. OK. \\nThis was our short introduction to filters in \\ntableaux. \\nThis will do for now. \\nThanks for watching. \\n \\n## Working with joins in Tableau \\nOne of the most important aspects of your work \\nin tableaux is the data source you are using to \\nperform analysis quite often, the data will be \\nstored in multiple locations and hence, \\nyou will have to deal with a number of data \\nsources which live in different environments. \\nNevertheless, you are going to want to use all \\nof the data available to you and run analysis \\non everything together. \\nThe way we merge multiple data sources is by \\nusing joins for those of you who have already \\nfollowed our program and especially our SQL \\nvideos you'll be familiar with what follows in \\nthis video. \\nSo feel free to skip or continue watching as a \\nrefresher for the rest. \\nPlease follow along when we want to perform \\ncross data table joins. \\nWe want to combine two or more data tables to \\ncreate a unique database. \\nHow do we join separate data tables? \\nWell, there are a few ways to do that. \\nWe can create an inner, outer left or a right \\njoint. \\nLet's open an Excel file to demonstrate a bit \\nbetter what each type of joint represents. \\nHere, we have two very simple tables. \\nThe first one shows us the age of three \\nbasketball players and the second one shows us \\nthe salary of basketball players. \\nPlease note that the two tables are different \\ndue to their last rows. \\nWe have lebron James in the first one and Kyrie \\nIrving in the second. \\nOk, let's say we would like to run some \\nanalysis and use the data available in both \\ntables. \\nTherefore, as described earlier, we have to use \\njoints. \\nBut how do we do that? \\nWe can easily see that the two tables have one \\ncolumn in common. \\nThe basketball player column, this column will \\nserve as a key. \\nWhen we put together the information from both \\ntables, a left join would mean that the left \\ncolumn of the first table will lead the way we \\nwill use it to create a table containing \\nage and salary information about the three \\nplayers we see here. \\nWhenever we find one of these players to the \\nright, we'll add their salary in the new table. \\nAs you can see here if their name is not \\npresent to the right, \\nwhich is the case with lebron james' salary, we \\nwill have a null value in the table. \\nIf a player's name is not present in the left \\ncolumn of the first table, \\nwe will not include any information about them \\nas this is a left join and any rows \\nwhich are not present in the key field of the \\nleft table are omitted in the new table. \\nA right join functions. \\nIn the same way. \\nHowever, this time, the left column of the \\nsecond table leads the way Kyrie \\nIrving replaces lebron James who is not present \\nin the left table. \\nHence, the only missing value would be Kyrie \\nIrving's age. \\nGiven that the only information we have about \\nhim is in the right table. \\nThe case when we are interested in the \\nintersection of the two tables only is called \\nan inner join. \\nThis is when we create a table that contains \\nrows where we have an exact match between the \\nkey fields we are joining the two tables with \\nin our case, \\nbasketball player. \\nThis time, the newly created table contains two \\nrows, only, \\nboth tables contain information about these \\nplayers. \\nHence, this is an inner join. \\nAn outer join would be the opposite case we add \\nall rows of the two tables regardless of \\nwhether there is a match in the key field we \\nare linking with. \\nWhen there isn't, we would have null values, \\nwhich is the case with both lebron James and \\nKyrie Irving. \\nHere, these are the main principles you need to \\nunderstand when deciding whether to create a \\nleft, right, \\ninner or outer join in tableaux depending on \\nyour needs. \\nAnd on the specific case you are working on, \\nyou will be able to apply one of these \\nstructures and join your data. \\n \\n# The Tableau Exercise \\n## Introduction to the exercise \\nHello and welcome back. \\nNow that we are nearly finished with our \\nintroduction to Tableau. \\nIt is time to start creating great looking \\ncharts and use them to build a complete \\ndashboard. \\nThis is way more exciting than getting \\nacquainted with Tableau's interface. \\nIsn't it to do that? \\nWe'll solve a complete real life exercise and \\neach lesson will build upon the previous one. \\nSounds great. Right. \\nAll right. \\nThen let's get started. \\nHere's the Excel data we'll use. \\nIt was provided by a company that has produced \\nseveral audio books and has been selling them \\nat an online marketplace. \\nOne of the main components of that marketplace \\nis reviews. \\nSo we have two files, one about sales and \\nanother one containing information about \\nreviews. \\nCustomers left for each audio book, \\nboth files contain the date when a purchase or \\na review occurred. \\nIt will be great if we manage to produce a \\ntable that takes advantage of both types of \\ndata we have when a person bought an audiobook \\nand when and with which rating a \\nperson left a review. \\nIf we manage to do that, we'll be able to \\ncreate several different charts in Tableau that \\nwould allow us to learn if the number of \\nreviews the company receives has been growing. \\nHow did the average review score change over \\ntime? \\nWhat is the percentage breakdown between 10 \\nstar, nine star, \\neight star and other types of reviews? \\nWhat percentage of people acquiring an \\naudiobook? \\nLeave a review, visualize the correlation \\nbetween audiobook sales and number of \\nreviews or perhaps visualize the correlation \\nbetween average review score and sales \\nin the lessons to come. \\nYou'll see how to do all of that. \\nStay tuned and thanks for watching. \\n## Let's create a dashboard - Visualizing the three charts we want to create \\nAll right, very good. \\nLet's take a look at the following picture. \\nThis is where we want to get by the end of our \\nexercise. \\nOur goal is to create a dashboard containing \\nthree charts, \\na chart showing us the number of reviews with a \\nsecond axis measuring the monthly average score. \\nThen we would like to create a pie chart \\nshowing us the percentage of reviews each \\naudiobook obtained. \\nFor example, 50% audiobook, \\n1 25% audiobook, 2 10% audiobook three and so \\non. \\nAnd finally, we would like to create a chart \\nthat gives us information about the ratio \\nbetween reviews left and the number of \\naudiobook purchases. \\nSuch a visualization would help us understand \\nwhat portion of people buying an audiobook, \\nlisten to it and then leave a review. Ok. \\nThese three charts will be the foundation of \\nthe dashboard we will create later on. \\nAnd I've added a note on the side showing us \\nthat once the dashboard is ready, \\nwe will be able to look at the aggregate data \\nor use a filter to monitor the performance of \\nindividual audio books. \\nSounds exciting, right? \\nAs a side note here, I would like to add that \\nin general, \\nit is a good practice to sit down and design \\nyour dashboards before you start working in \\ntableaux. \\nThis allows you to have a predefined idea of \\nwhat you would like to achieve and to check \\nwhether you are able to do that at the end. \\nMoreover, and what is probably most important, \\nthis allows you to think what visualizations \\nmake sense from a business perspective. \\nOK, great. \\nLet's get right into it in our next lesson. \\n## Using Joins in Tableau \\nAs usual. \\nThe first thing we need to do when starting a \\nnew project is load our data. \\nOur two source files are audiobook reviews and \\naudiobook sales. \\nLet's connect them to Tableau. \\nHere's the audio book reviews file in the same \\nfolder. \\nWe also have the audiobook sales file. \\nWe'll need both. \\nSo I'll click on add and we'll load the other \\nfiles too in order to be able to use the \\ninformation of both tables at the same time, \\nwe'll have to combine them somehow to do that. \\nWe must double click at the audiobook \\nsales gray button that is in front of us. \\nThen we can drag the audiobook reviews \\ntable from the sheets field on the left. \\nWe've just created the join. \\nWe need excellent what we want to obtain by \\ndoing that is a unique table containing \\ninformation about all transactions for all \\naudio books and the respective reviews left by \\nclients whenever they chose to do so, \\nthe transaction ID column is the perfect link \\nbetween the two files as it is available \\nin both. \\nAnd it could serve as a common field based on \\nwhich we could link the two tables together. \\nSo one of the main aspects we'll explore in \\nthis lesson is how to create a connection \\nbetween two tables in tableaux. \\nPlease remember that we will distinguish the \\nterms data connection and table connection. \\nTable connection is performed by \\nfunctionalities like joining or blending. \\nIt refers to combining data from two or more \\ndata sources. \\nData connection instead represents a single \\ndata source connection between Tableau \\nand a data source such as an Excel workbook or \\nan SQL database. \\nWhen we imported the second file Tableau did \\nsome work for us in the background and created \\na connection between the two files. \\nThe symbol you see here is an indication we've \\ncreated an inner join. \\nTechnically speaking, when creating a join, \\nTableau sends a query to the database, \\nthe joint is implemented on the relevant tables \\nat the database level and the output of the \\noperation is brought back to Tableau where it \\nis ready to be used for analysis. \\nAnd inner join means that the two tables we've \\nadded have a field in common and we \\ncan combine them using that field. \\nLet me hover my mouse over the symbol tableau \\nindicates that it has created an inner \\njoin using the parameter audiobook name. \\nWe don't want that. \\nWe want to link the two tables according to the \\ntransaction id parameter. \\nAs our analysis will be focused on user sales \\nand reviews. \\nSo I'll click on the inner join symbol and \\nwe'll open the join menu first \\noff. \\nLet me substitute the field we use. \\nIn order to create a connection between the two \\ntables, I would like to create a connection \\nusing the transaction ID field. \\nAnd here we are, here's a preview of the table \\nwe've created through an inner join and \\ntransaction ID as the primary key as shown in \\nthe diagram. \\nWhen we create an interj join between the two \\ntables, we consider their intersection the \\nsituation where the primary key is found in \\nboth tables. \\nTo give you an example, if a person who has a \\ngiven transaction ID purchased a course \\nbut did not leave a review, then they won't be \\nincluded in this table. \\nAnd inner join would require users who have \\npurchased a course to have left a rating \\nand both the date of purchase and the date when \\nthe rating was posted to be known. \\nBasically, it contains only the rows in which \\nwe have a transaction ID, \\na date of purchase, a date of review, a review \\nrating and information regarding which was the \\naudio book that was purchased and rated. \\nFor example, all the cases when a person bought \\nan audio book but did not rate, \\nit are not considered. \\nDo you think this information is important? \\nDo we want to be able to understand how reviews \\nimpacted sales and whether we can see a \\npattern in total purchases with respect to \\nreviews? \\nOf course, we'll need this information. \\nAnd if we use an inner join, we are not going \\nto have it. \\nTherefore, we'll need a different type of join. \\nOne that includes the information about \\npurchases and people who did not rate an audio \\nbook. \\nSo looking at the tiny diagram we have here, \\nI am going to select a left join. \\nGiven that the audiobook sales file is on the \\nleft side. \\nWe want to have a table that contains \\ninformation regarding audiobook purchases, \\nall of the audiobook purchases. \\nAnd the case is when people who bought these \\nbooks provided a rating and a left join is more \\nsuitable than an inner join in \\nthis case. \\nOk, great. \\nIn our next lesson, we'll make a check to see \\nwhether the data we've connected to Tableau is \\ncorrect. \\nThis will do for now. \\n## Performing a Numbers Check - Attempt #1 \\nRight. \\nOur pace is excellent. \\nIn this lesson, we would like to make sure that \\nthe data we've loaded through a join is truly \\nrepresentative of the figures we have in the \\ntwo source files, \\nright? \\nLet's open sheet one and do a few checks. \\nFirst off, I would like to see how many sales \\ntransactions were registered in total. \\nLet's drag the number of records field into the \\nworkspace area. \\nTableau is really quick and tells us that there \\nare 110,570 rows \\nwith transaction ID information. \\nThese are the actual sales of audio books that \\noccurred throughout the entire period of \\nanalysis. \\nA quick look into the sales Excel file shows us \\nthat this number is precisely the one we should \\nhave. \\nOk, let's change the format of the date of \\npurchase field to date, \\nshall we? \\nI like it much better up here among the \\ndimensions fields and with a calendar icon \\nright next to it, \\nsuggesting this is a date field. \\nNext, I'll test for the number of ratings we \\nhave in the reviews file. \\nI'll simply drop the ratings field into the \\nworkspace area and the result we have is \\n96,897 which is too high. \\nWhy is that? \\nWell, we are summing not counting, \\nthis is the actual sum of all ratings that have \\nbeen left by students. \\nWe want to count the number of ratings instead. \\nHere, that's much better. \\nPeople who bought our audio books left a total \\nof 10,798 ratings. \\nLet's make sure that this number is fine as \\nwell. \\nOk, here it is very well. \\nOne final check and we are good to go. \\nLet's add the date of purchase field to the \\ncolumns of our workspace. \\nMoreover, I'll increase the level of \\ngranularity of our data and we'll opt for a \\nmonthly breakdown. \\nThat's something we can do fairly easily and is \\none of Tableau's strongest features. \\nGranularity is a term that you will encounter \\nquite often while working with Tableau. \\nIt is very important to understand what it is \\nused for. \\nIn fact, it simply refers to the following the \\nlevel of detail in a field of a data set. \\nIn our example, this means taking a daily, \\nweekly, monthly or yearly \\nbreakdown are all different levels of \\ngranularity of the date of purchase field of \\nthe audiobook sales data source. \\nHere's the monthly breakdown of reviews. \\nWait, there is something strange according to \\nTableau, we did not receive any \\nreviews in December 2017. \\nHowever, I do know for a fact that we did. \\nHere's the proof in our Excel file. \\nWhat happened? \\nTableau gets confused pretty easily when we \\njoin the data and then use a dimension \\nsuch as purchase date from the sales file and \\nanother field such as rating from the reviews \\nfile. \\nFor some reason, the date fields of the two \\ntables we joined do not match up with each \\nother correctly. \\nWhenever you experience such issues, it is best \\nto use data blending and alternative to \\ntableau joints. \\nThat's precisely what we will do in our next \\nlesson. \\nThanks for watching. \\n## Blending Data in Tableau \\nData blending is a method of combining data \\nthat supplements a table of data from one data \\nsource with columns of data from another data \\nsource. \\nIn our case, we would combine the sales data \\nfrom the audiobook sales file with the \\nratings column from the audiobook reviews file. \\nHow does blending differ from joining? \\nYou can think of a data blend as a specific \\ntype of left joint that is preferable or \\nnecessary to be applied depending on various \\nconditions. \\nSometimes using a joint will do a perfect job \\nwhile in other situations blending will either \\ndeliver better or quicker results or be the \\nonly solution. \\nMoreover joining data is something you do \\nmanually. \\nWhereas data blending is a functionality that \\ntableau implements automatically \\nwhile you are working on your sheet. \\nThis makes it a more intuitive feature to use \\nprovided that the following conditions are met. \\nBoth data tables are separate data sources. \\nThere is a field that serves as the connection \\nbetween them and would allow us to carry out \\nqueries that leverage information from both \\ntables. \\nSo one of the preliminary basic requirements to \\nblend data in tablet is to have a common field \\ncreating the connection between the two \\ndata tables. \\nFrom a technical perspective. \\nWhat blending does is take separate query \\nresults from each data source and \\naggregate them in the view that is in Tableau \\nonly then it will \\nconnect and join the query results on the same \\ncommon field which should contain information \\nof the same data type. \\nThis is different from the case when you are \\nusing a joint where the aggregation is \\nhappening at the database level and just the \\noutput of the joint is being brought back to \\ntableau when blending, the aggregation occurs \\nin tableau. \\nSo what are the benefits of blending data? \\nIt turns out that joining or blending can bring \\ndifferent results. \\nAnd here is the tricky part. \\nIf you join two data tables containing \\nduplicate values that are not aggregated \\nproperly in while doing some preliminary work \\non the data, you will obtain an artificially \\ninflated data set in tableaux \\nblending solves that problem automatically \\ntableau will consider the level of granularity \\nyou have chosen in the view in other words, in \\nyour sheet and will combine the data sources \\nwith aggregated fields directly. \\nOK? \\nI think we are ready to create an actual blend \\nin tableaux. \\nLet's open the audiobook sales file first. \\nThen once I've opened the file, I'll open a \\nsheet and click on new data source from the \\ndata tab. \\nThis is how we will create a new data \\nconnection and we load both files at the same \\ntime without creating a joint. \\nAs we can see here, both files are open in \\nTableau to make sure we've created a blend. \\nI can open the edit relationships, dialogue box \\nand see whether tableaux has created a \\nconnection between the two files. \\nIn our case, things are pretty straightforward \\nbecause Tableau immediately recognized that the \\ntwo files contain columns with the same name, \\ntransaction ID. \\nThe primary data source is the audiobook sales \\nfile which is excellent. \\nThis means it would represent the left table of \\nthe left join performed while blending the \\ndata tableaux. \\nOr alternatively, the view will use all rows \\nfrom audiobook sales audiobook review instead \\nacts as a secondary data \\nsource, the right table. \\nTherefore, while blending tableau will use the \\naggregated rows from this data source based on \\nthe dimension of the common fields. \\nFor the sake of exercise. \\nLet's select the custom relationship radio \\nbutton and choose not one but two different \\nfields that serve as the connection between the \\ntwo files. \\nThis is similar to having a two column, \\nprimary key and a two column foreign key in SQL. \\nI'll click on add \\nand then would like to connect the date of \\nreview and the date of purchase. \\nHm I can't see the date of purchase in here. \\nWhat is the reason? \\nWell, Tableau didn't recognize that this is a \\ndimension and added this field \\namong measures. \\nLet's change its data type and open the edit \\nrelationships window and select to add a \\nnew custom relationship which connects the two \\nfiles based on the date of purchase and on \\nreview date. \\nAnd that's how we edit the relationship \\ntableaux created. \\nRight? \\nLet's switch back to the automatic connection \\ntableau created in our next video. \\nWe'll test whether blending solved the problem \\nwe experienced earlier. \\nHopefully we will be able to combine sales and \\nreviews without any problems. \\nStay tuned. \\n## Performing a Numbers Check - Attempt #2 \\nNow that we have created a blend, we can go \\nahead and make a quick check. \\nThat would allow us to see if the numbers we \\nwill work with. \\nLook fine this time. \\nLet's start with the number of sales \\ntransactions. \\nFirst, I'll simply drag the measure values \\nfield into the workspace area. \\n110,570. \\nPrecisely what we expected. Good. \\nThe number of sales transactions is the one we \\nexpected. \\nNext, I'll remove this field and open the \\naudiobook reviews data to check the number of \\nratings we have, \\nI'll simply drag and drop the rating field. \\nBut this time tableaux displays an error. \\nIt tells us that fields cannot be used from the \\naudiobook reviews data source because there is \\nno relationship to the primary data source. \\nWe find out our data is not blended yet \\nto do that. \\nWe have to click on the tiny link icon right \\nnext to transaction id and choose this to be \\nour linking field. \\nThe error we observed previously is not going \\nto appear again because our two data sources \\nare properly linked now. Great. \\nThis is a field that shouldn't be summed but \\ncounted as we are interested in the number of \\nratings left by students and not by the total \\nsum of their ratings. \\n10,798. \\nAgain, the number we expected to see it's time \\nfor the true test. \\nThese numbers were ok. \\nThe last time too, \\nremember, let's plot the number of reviews and \\nthe date of purchase field from the \\naudiobook sales file. \\nAll I have to do is add date of purchase in \\ncolumns and then choose a monthly breakdown \\ninstead of annual breakdown. \\nOh, no, December 2017 is empty again. \\nWhat can we do now? \\nBlending doesn't work either. \\nLet's have some faith. \\nWe'll figure it out. \\nI'll go to data and open the edit relationships \\nmenu here, \\nwe can choose the primary data source which \\nshould be audiobook sales and the fields that \\nserve as a link between the two files. \\nLet's opt for a custom selection and add the \\nfollowing fields. \\nFirst, I'll link the year of review date with \\nthe year of purchase date and \\nthe month of review date with the month of \\npurchase date. \\nOnce we are ready, we can click. \\nOk, and see if the situation changed the same. \\nCheck the count of number of reviews with \\nrespect to purchasing date will show us whether \\nwe've managed to solve the problem by using a \\ndifferent linking field and it appears that it \\nhas here's a timeline that shows the number of \\nratings left each month. \\nWe have 653 reviews for December, not zero. \\nAnd that's excellent. Wow. \\nIt took us a while, \\nbut we figured it out. \\nWe had to edit relationships and adjust the \\nfield that serves as a link between the two \\nfiles. \\nOtherwise we would have been left with a wrong \\ngraph. \\nAnd that would be unacceptable in a \\nprofessional environment as wrong \\nvisualizations lead to wrong business insights \\nin our next lesson. \\nWe'll create the first chart for our dashboard. \\nThanks for watching. \\n## First chart \\nOk, excellent. \\nWe are ready to start with the first chart that \\nwill be inserted in our dashboard. \\nTherefore, I'll rename the worksheet's name to \\nchart one. \\nOk, good. \\nLet's add the date of review information into \\ncolumns and this is where we will be able to \\nsee the timing of purchases and reviews. \\nAs usual, \\nwe are interested in a breakdown by months. \\nSo I'll select month, the workspace area shows \\nus that review dates \\nrange from February 2017 to February 2018, \\nwhich \\nis what we expected to see. \\nLet's insert some data, shall we first? \\nI'll add the number of ratings using the count \\nfunction. \\nEverything's fine and we have data for December \\n2017. \\nSo we can forget about that problem. \\nAccording to our initial plan, this will be a \\nchart that shows the number of reviews and the \\naverage review score per month displayed on a \\nsecondary axis. \\nSo I'll add the rating field to rose for the \\nsecond time. \\nBut this time we want the average of these \\nnumbers and we would like to create a dual axis. \\nExcellent. \\nObviously, we will have to fine tune the axis \\nscale. \\nA bit as right now, the chart doesn't show a \\nmatch. \\nI'll simply double click and choose a fixed \\nrange starting from eight and going all the way \\nup to 10, \\nwhich is the maximum review score we can have. \\nHowever, right now, the two charts overlap in a \\nstrange way and we are unable to see their \\ntrends. \\nSo I'll increase the size of the axis to 12 and \\nwe'll change the full color of both variables, \\nnumber of ratings and average ratings. \\nThat's easy to do. \\nI need to select one of the two variables and \\nthen click on the color button under marks. \\nOnce we've opened the edit colors menu, we can \\nchoose which variables color we would like to \\nchange to a color. \\nWe like better. \\nI like yellow and blue. Awesome. \\nI'm not really a fan of opacity which adds a \\ntransparency effect and sort of mixes the \\ncolors we have in our chart. \\nTherefore, I'll opt for 100% opacity for both \\nvariables. \\nSee the chart looks nicer. \\nLet's edit its axis again. \\nThat's something which is quite easy to do. \\nWe have to double click on a specific axis and \\ntype the axis title we would like to have, \\nI'll change counter rating to number of ratings, \\nmonth of review date, \\ntwo month. \\nAnd I believe the average rating doesn't need \\nto be changed. \\nVery good. \\nThis is our first chart. \\nDoes it give us any meaningful information? \\nWell, yes, I believe it does. \\nFirst off, we can see that the number of \\nreviews left by people has been increasing, \\nwhich is pretty great. \\nThe average review score is almost nine and \\nsometimes even higher than nine, \\nwhich is a pretty high score but should be \\ninterpreted. \\nAnd compared with the rest of the market. \\nMoreover, we don't see a dependence between \\nnumber of reviews and average ratings, \\nwhich means that average review scores are not \\ninfluenced by the number of people leaving \\nreviews. \\nAll of this is quite interesting. \\nLet's keep up the good work we have been doing \\nin our next lesson when we will create the \\nsecond chart for our dashboard. \\nThanks for watching. \\n## Second chart \\nHi and welcome back in this video. \\nWe'll create the second chart which will be \\npart of our dashboard a pie chart showing the \\npercentage of the total reviews that each \\naudiobook obtained. \\nThe number of reviews is quite important in the \\nmarketplace we are studying and this is the \\nreason why we are interested in finding out \\nwhich audiobooks collected more reviews and \\nalternative visualization would be a pie chart \\nshowing us the percentage of people who \\npurchased a given audio book. Ok. \\nGiven that we know what we would like to \\naccomplish things should be easier, right? \\nI'll add the rating field to the workspace area. \\nThe number we obtained is the sum for all \\nratings. \\nLet's use count for this measure. Perfect. \\nThe total number of reviews is \\n10,798. \\nAnd we know for a fact that that is true. \\nLet's go ahead and add the audiobook names \\ndimension above the rating field, shall we? \\nThis creates a breakdown by audiobook exactly \\nwhat we want to have. \\nNow, I can simply select the pie chart icon \\nwithin the show me functionality and I'll \\ncreate a pie chart, a really tiny one but still \\na pie chart to increase the charts \\nsize. \\nI can simply click anywhere in the workspace \\narea, hold the control key and then use the \\narrow keys. \\nIf I press control and up the chart grows \\nvertically while control and right \\narrow increases the charts size horizontally, \\nthe opposite is true as well. \\nWe can decrease the charts size by pressing \\ncontrol and down key or control and left \\narrow. Awesome. \\nWhat else we need labels? \\nRight? \\nOtherwise, it is difficult to gain an idea what \\nportion of overall reviews a specific \\naudiobook accounted for. \\nI'll drag the rating field in label and a \\nnumber of reviews appears right next to each \\naudio book. \\nAgain, we need the count of ratings and not the \\nsum. \\nOk. \\nBut how do we display these as a percentage? \\nThat's not that difficult. \\nActually, all I have to do is go to analysis, \\nselect percentage of and then click on table. \\nBoom. \\nHere we are. \\nThese are the percentages each audiobook \\naccounted for among the total number of reviews, \\nthe pie charts and the labels we added shows us \\nthat audio books, one and two accounted for \\nmore than 50% of the total number of \\nreviews the company received. \\nVery interesting. \\nThe business relies greatly on these best \\nsellers. \\nIn our next lesson. \\nWe'll create the third and final chart that \\nwould allow us to complete our initial plan and \\nobtain the dashboard we intended from the very \\nbeginning \\n## Third Chart \\nOk, we are almost there ready for chart number \\nthree. \\nI hope you are. \\nHere we go. \\nIn this lesson. \\nWe would like to create a chart that gives us \\ninformation about the ratio between reviews \\nleft and the number of audiobook \\npurchases in a given month. \\nAn important KP I showing us whether people who \\nbuy audiobooks leave reviews to do that. \\nWe'll need to create a few calculated fields. \\nFirst, let's create a field which counts the \\nnumber of ratings, \\nnot the sum of all ratings, but their count. \\nIt will be much easier if we create this field \\nand use it going forward. \\nThe name of the field we are creating is number \\nof ratings and I simply need to use the \\ncount function. \\nThe next calculated field I would like to \\ncreate is number of purchases. \\nLet's change the data source. \\nWe've selected to audiobook sales here. \\nI will create a field called number of \\npurchases which will contain the number of \\naudiobook sales the company made. \\nHow do I count the number of purchases? \\nWell, the transaction ID code is unique, right? \\nIf we count it, we should obtain the number of \\nsales transactions which is precisely what we \\nare looking for. \\nOk, good. \\nWe are almost ready now, we can create the last \\ncalculated field which will be the ratio \\nbetween reviews and new purchases. \\nLet's do that. \\nIt is a fairly easy task given that we've \\nalready created the number of reviews and the \\nnumber of purchases all we have to do is divide \\nthe two figures and we'll obtain the measure we \\nwant to plot from the very beginning. \\nLet's add it to the rows of our visualization. \\nThe result is a pretty nice bar chart which is \\na bit too large but still looks meaningful. \\nIt appears that the ratio of ratings to new \\nstudents was significantly lower in November \\n2017 and way higher the month before three \\ntimes lower to be precise. \\nI am sure the firm's Business intelligence team \\nwould want to have a look at that and analyze \\nwhat the reason is for this. \\nLet's quickly edit the title of the horizontal \\naxis to month and save our work \\nin our next lesson. \\nWe'll organize the charts we created in a \\ndashboard. \\nStay tuned and thanks for watching. \\n## Creating and Formatting a Dashboard \\nCongratulations on making it this far in our \\nTableau training. \\nLet's take a moment to see how much we have \\ncovered to this point. \\nWe started off by learning when and how Tableau \\ncan be useful in corporate decision making and \\nlearned how to install Tableau's free version \\nTableau public. \\nWe then learned how to connect data to Tableau \\nand what we can do with the different parts of \\nthe Tableau interface. \\nNot long after we created your first Tableau \\nchart, we learned how to duplicate sheets \\nand how to create tables. \\nThen we learned how to create custom fields in \\norder to manipulate our data within tableau \\neasily. \\nIn addition, we learned how to add totals and \\nsub totals to our tables and how to work with \\nfilters. \\nWe explored functionalities allowing us to work \\nwith multiple data sources such as joins and \\ndata blending. \\nAnd most recently, we created three meaningful \\ncharts. \\nNow we are going to build our dashboard which \\nwill be the last piece of the puzzle really. \\nIt will be interesting to put all three charts \\nright next to each other and see the type of \\ninsights we can get by analyzing them in one \\nplace. \\nOK. \\nLet's get right into it to create a new \\ndashboard. \\nI'll click on the tiny icon we have here. \\nSee when we hover the mouse over it, it starts \\ndisplaying new dashboard. \\nOnce the dashboard has been created, my first \\ntask would be to modify its size right now. \\nIt is a bit too small, isn't it? \\nI can adjust the size settings from the left \\npart of the dashboard screen. \\nLet's work with a range that is 1000 pixels \\nwide and has a height of 800 pixels. \\nI hope you are watching this video from a large \\nscreen. \\nOK. \\nLet's drag and drop the three charts. \\nAll I have to do is drag them and place each \\nchart where I want it. \\nTableau is quite smart and manages to find \\nspace and guesses what we want to do when \\nwe position the cursor above the dashboard area. \\nOf course, there are a few things that need to \\nbe adjusted. \\nI'll remove the legends. \\nWe don't need leaving the audiobooks legend. \\nOnly moreover, I would like to place the \\naudiobook legend below the pie chart. \\nIt belongs to this way. \\nWhat we are doing will be much clearer. \\nI'll simply press on the legend and then grab \\nthe part you see here, \\ndragging it below the pie chart. \\nLet's resize a bit to get rid of the arrows. \\nPerfect. \\nNow, to remove the arrows of the pie chart and \\nfit it in its allocated space without any \\nproblems we'll need to adjust its size from the \\nchart to sheet. \\nLet's go there and reduce the pie charts size \\njust a tiny bit horizontally and vertically \\nand then we can go back to the dashboard sheet \\nand see what happened. \\nOk, great. \\nThe arrows disappeared. \\nWe are one step closer. \\nLet's change the chart titles a bit because \\nfrankly, they don't mean that much. \\nWe should have done it earlier, but better late \\nthan never. \\nRight. \\nA good title for the first chart would be \\nnumber of reviews and average rating. \\nAlso, I would like to adjust its font size to \\n11 and put the text in bold. \\nWe'll do the same for the other charts too in \\norder to be consistent, \\nwhich is quite important. \\nWhen building a dashboard, \\nthe title of the pie chart would be number of \\nreviews by audiobook, \\nas promised, I'll apply a font size of 11 and a \\nbold text effect. \\nAnd lastly, the title of the third chart will \\nbe ratio of reviews to sales \\nvery well. \\nOur dashboard is almost ready in our next \\nlesson. \\nI will show you how we can add a filter and \\nmake this a truly interactive tool that allows \\nus to dig deeper and filter all three charts. \\nContemporaneously. \\n## Adding Interactive Filters for Improved Analysis \\nOk, guys, we are almost there. \\nOur goal in this lesson would be to add a \\nfilter to our data and be able to look at the \\ndashboard and choose which audio books we would \\nlike to analyze and simply select them from the \\nfilter. \\nSounds useful, right? \\nThe data we see here is quite meaningful and \\nshows us some important trends. \\nHowever, actionable decisions will probably \\nhave to be made at the audiobook level and will \\nneed to be specific for each of the audiobooks \\nour firm sells addressing the story we see here. \\nAll right, let's add a filter to chart number \\ntwo, the pie chart. \\nI'll simply click on the tiny arrow in its \\nright corner containing more options and we'll \\napply audiobook name as a filter again. \\nWe'll have to adjust the charts, \\nsize and position in the dashboard a bit to \\nremove the arrows very well. \\nI think this will do. \\nNow when I use the filter, \\nall changes that occur are for the pie chart, \\nonly the other two charts remain intact as the \\nfilter we just added has no power over them at \\nthe moment. \\nAnd we want to be able to use this filter in \\norder to modify the entire dashboard and not \\nonly one of its charts, how do we do that? \\nLet's select the tiny arrow in the upper right \\ncorner of the filter and go to apply to \\nworksheets where we will be able to click on \\nselected worksheets in the dialog box that \\nopens, I can easily add chart one and chart \\nthree and then press \\nOK. \\nI hope the filter makes changes to all three \\ncharts now. \\nAnd yes, it does nice. \\nHowever, one thing is a bit suspicious when I \\nUN filter the first few audio books, \\nthe ratio of reviews to sales continues to \\ndecrease. \\nAnd this makes no sense. \\nIt appears that right now the ratios are all \\ncalculated with respect to the total number of \\naudio books. Hm. \\nThat's strange. \\nLet's check. \\nI suspect something is not as it should be when \\nI go and take a look at the other two \\ncharts. \\nI see that the blending connection has not been \\nactivated for the audiobook name field. \\nLet's activate the connection for both and see \\nif this changes things. \\nNow when I unfiltered the first few audiobooks, \\nthe percentage doesn't decrease, \\nbut it even goes up. \\nI believe it's fine. \\nNow, please bear in mind the following. \\nIf I would like to use some of the charts \\nelements as a filter, \\nall I have to do is select, use as filter in \\nthe upper right corner of a chart and then \\nall three charts will be updated. \\nThis is another way to play around with filters, \\nwhether we filter data from the actual filter \\nor simply click on a given chart element. \\nIt doesn't make much of a difference in both \\ncases. \\nA filter will be applied. \\nWe've constructed a dashboard that can easily \\nbe filtered and unfiltered from here. \\nNow, we can explore the relationship between \\ndifferent audio books, \\nthe number of reviews they received their \\naverage score and the ratio between reviews and \\naudiobook sales. \\nThat's awesome play around with the data and do \\nnot hesitate to share with us the insights you \\nmanaged to uncover great job getting to the end \\nof this exercise. \\nIt was a real pleasure teaching you tableau and \\nwe hope to see you soon in some of our other \\nmodules until then a warm hug and thanks for \\nwatching. \\n## Interactive filters - fix \\nHi, one many of you experience difficulties \\nwith this part of the exercise, \\ncreating filters in this video. \\nOur goal will be to shed some light and \\nhopefully clarify your doubts before applying \\nthe filter to all three charts. \\nYou need to make sure the blending connections \\nare working. \\nGo to chart one and click on data, edit \\nrelationships. \\nThen you need to make sure there is a relation \\nfor audiobook names. \\nOnce this is done, check for all three charts. \\nIf the blending connections are turned on, \\nthey need to be colored in red to make this \\ncheck, you need to click on the data source \\naudiobook sales and click on the icon next to \\nthe audiobook names. \\nOnce the connections are turned on, you will be \\nable to proceeded and add the filter. \\nWhat you need to do is select the pie chart \\nchart two and click on the tiny arrow in the \\nupper right corner. \\nThen select filter audiobook name. \\nIn order to use this filter to modify the whole \\ndashboard, you need to go to the right corner \\nof the dashboard where the audiobook names are \\nplaced again, \\nselect the tiny arrow and click on. \\nApply to worksheets, \\nthen select selected worksheets and mark all \\ncharts. \\nOk. \\nNow the filter should be working properly. \\nPlease make a check and see. \\nThat's the case in your own workbook too. \\nThanks for watching. \""

      "Tableaux. \n",
      "I am sure you are anxious to create some \n",
      "fascinating visualizations. \n",
      "So let's get started. \n",
      "First off, we need to learn how to connect \n",
      "Tableau to the data source we will be working \n",
      "with. \n",
      "There are two options, we can either create a \n",
      "connection to a file or a server. \n",
      "Of course, \n",
      "we'll choose one of the two depending on where \n",
      "the data is. \n",
      "Let's connect Tableau to a Microsoft Excel file \n",
      "in general. \n",
      "Every time we use a source file in one of the \n",
      "lectures, you will be able to find it in the \n",
      "supplemental resources section. \n",
      "Just open your course curriculum and download \n",
      "the available files for that lesson. \n",
      "See, OK, great. \n",
      "I'll select the file called GDP data and under \n",
      "connections. \n",
      "I can now see that Tableau opened the file. \n",
      "Our source has three sheets, data, metadata, \n",
      "countries and \n",
      "metadata indicators. \n",
      "What we usually have to do is choose the \n",
      "worksheet we'll need and drag into the upper \n",
      "part of the screen where drag sheets here is \n",
      "written. \n",
      "Once we do that tableaux is going to activate \n",
      "the sheet we selected and provide us with a \n",
      "preview of the data we have inside the first \n",
      "two rows of the sheet are empty. \n",
      "And hence, we see all of these null values \n",
      "tableaux is really smart \n",
      "and can often help us with similar issues. \n",
      "As you can see here, the program suggests using \n",
      "its data interpreter functionality \n",
      "to clean the data. \n",
      "All right, let's do that. \n",
      "And voila the first two rows containing no \n",
      "values disappeared. \n",
      "That's awesome. \n",
      "In our next video, we'll open our first tableau \n",
      "worksheet and I'll be happy to introduce you to \n",
      "its structure. \n",
      "This will do for now. \n",
      "Thanks for watching. \n",
      " \n",
      "## Exploring Tableau's interface \n",
      "So we've already connected our file to tableaux. \n",
      "Now, in this lesson, we'll be creating our \n",
      "first sheet. \n",
      "It's really easy to do and resembles how we \n",
      "create a sheet in Excel or pretty much \n",
      "every other spreadsheet software. \n",
      "All I have to do is click here and a new sheet \n",
      "will be created, right? \n",
      "This is what a Tableau sheet looks like. \n",
      "We can have as many of them as we want. \n",
      "I can simply click on this little icon at the \n",
      "bottom and a new worksheet is added. \n",
      "The other two icons which are next to it are \n",
      "for creating a new dashboard and a new \n",
      "story. \n",
      "We'll deal with dashboards further in the \n",
      "course. \n",
      "So we won't use these buttons for now. \n",
      "OK. \n",
      "Let's give some structure to what you are \n",
      "seeing here. \n",
      "If this software is new to you, \n",
      "things can be a bit confusing. \n",
      "So it will be best if we spend a few minutes. \n",
      "The remainder of this lesson talking you \n",
      "through Tableau's interface. \n",
      "First off, we have 10 different tabs on \n",
      "Tableau's default ribbon. \n",
      "These are file data worksheet dashboard, \n",
      "story analysis map format window \n",
      "and help. \n",
      "Let's quickly go through each of them. \n",
      "As with most programs, the file tab contains \n",
      "certain functionalities related to opening, \n",
      "closing and saving files if you would like to, \n",
      "you can also exit tableau from here. \n",
      "But why would you want to do that data? \n",
      "On the other hand is where you will find \n",
      "functionalities related to the data source you \n",
      "are using here, \n",
      "you can add a new data connection, replace an \n",
      "existing one or simply edit the data \n",
      "source of the worksheet you are working with. \n",
      "Next, we have the worksheet tab. \n",
      "It can be helpful when we want to create a new \n",
      "worksheet hide or show a charts, \n",
      "title caption summary and so on. \n",
      "I am sure you noticed that we already created a \n",
      "new sheet with the little icon we have at the \n",
      "bottom left corner of the sheet and we can do \n",
      "the same thing from the worksheet tab as well. \n",
      "Such repetition is common for most programs, \n",
      "functionalities available in the ribbon \n",
      "can be accessed in other ways too. \n",
      "In fact, I rarely use the ribbon \n",
      "functionalities, but it is good to have an \n",
      "overview and be aware that they are there. \n",
      "OK? \n",
      "Next, we have the dashboard and story tabs. \n",
      "As I said, we'll learn more about dashboards \n",
      "and stories later on. \n",
      "In the course, the analysis tab is where you \n",
      "can tweak your visualization in terms of \n",
      "labels, show figures as a percentage of the \n",
      "total add trend lines, \n",
      "legends filters and more. \n",
      "We'll explore many of these options later in \n",
      "the course for now, \n",
      "you can remember that here, we have some \n",
      "interesting functionalities related to the way \n",
      "we perform our analysis. \n",
      "And some of the tools we'll incorporate in it \n",
      "map is a tab that is helpful when we use \n",
      "Tableau's geographic visualization capabilities. \n",
      "Pretty soon. \n",
      "You will see that this is one of the most \n",
      "powerful and impressive tableau features. \n",
      "Of course, format can help us adjust the way \n",
      "our visualization appears from here. \n",
      "We can modify its font, font size, axis, \n",
      "backgrounds, \n",
      "labels, size and so much more. \n",
      "That's another tab containing plenty of useful \n",
      "functionalities. \n",
      "We'll explore later windows and help are two of \n",
      "the standard tabs we find in most \n",
      "programs. \n",
      "So I am not going to spend much time on them \n",
      "also because we are not going to use them \n",
      "throughout the course. \n",
      "However, one thing we should mention is that \n",
      "Tableau public has a nice and open community of \n",
      "users who will be able to help you and whose \n",
      "work you can look at if needed, \n",
      "all users of Tableau public who save their work, \n",
      "make it publicly available. \n",
      "Therefore, this can be a useful place where you \n",
      "can search for a given issue you need help with \n",
      "and see what comes up. \n",
      "So if I click on community and search for \n",
      "geography, I'll be able to see the \n",
      "work other users have saved previously, right? \n",
      "This is Tableau's ribbon \n",
      "below the ribbon, we have several buttons that \n",
      "can be quite helpful. \n",
      "The show start page button takes us to the \n",
      "screen we saw previously when we connected \n",
      "tableaux and our GDP data Excel file to get \n",
      "back to the sheet that was created earlier. \n",
      "I'll click here. \n",
      "I'm sure you know how to work with undo and \n",
      "redo. \n",
      "So if I were to drag one of the fields here, I \n",
      "can go back and undo this section with \n",
      "undo. \n",
      "Of course, see undone. \n",
      "Most of the typical windows shortcuts can be \n",
      "used here as well as you probably know. \n",
      "The shortcut for undo is control Z. \n",
      "On the right, we have other useful buttons such \n",
      "as save, \n",
      "allowing you to save the progress of your work. \n",
      "Quite intuitively. \n",
      "New data source opens the connect functionality \n",
      "we saw earlier. \n",
      "The other buttons we have here are new \n",
      "worksheet, clears, \n",
      "sheet swap rows and columns, sort and so on. \n",
      "We'll explore many of these throughout the \n",
      "course for now, \n",
      "it would be best if you simply gain an idea how \n",
      "various objects are positioned within Tableau's \n",
      "interface. OK. \n",
      "On the left side of Tableau's screen, \n",
      "we have two pas data and analytics. \n",
      "The data pane is quite important. \n",
      "It shows us what data we've loaded and then \n",
      "Tableau classifies the data into two \n",
      "types dimensions and measures to put it \n",
      "slightly differently. \n",
      "This is a distinction between categorical and \n",
      "numerical data. \n",
      "The data in the dimensions field cannot be \n",
      "aggregated. \n",
      "It is qualitative in nature. \n",
      "Quite the opposite measures can be aggregated \n",
      "and are quantitative in nature. \n",
      "In the next few lessons, we'll learn how to \n",
      "work with these fields. \n",
      "But for now, it would be nice if I just show \n",
      "you that we can drag dimensions and measures \n",
      "into the work area and use them to create our \n",
      "visualizations there. \n",
      "The work area is where we'll create our \n",
      "visualizations, dashboards and stories and \n",
      "this is one way to create a chart. \n",
      "I am sure you noticed that the columns and rows, \n",
      "part of the sheet started showing us the \n",
      "variables we've added to the workspace area. \n",
      "We'll explore this part of the interface in a \n",
      "separate video in a few lessons. \n",
      "OK. Perfect. \n",
      "What else do we have the show me button on the \n",
      "right, which allows us to adjust the type of \n",
      "visualization we use. \n",
      "It is a very cool feature because tableau tells \n",
      "us what types of visualizations we can \n",
      "choose from as not all charts will be available \n",
      "depending on the data we have chosen to work \n",
      "with. \n",
      "Once we decide we would like to switch to a \n",
      "different chart, all we need to do is select \n",
      "the respective type of chart and tableau makes \n",
      "the adjustment for us neat, right? \n",
      "And finally, here in the middle, we have three \n",
      "important sections, \n",
      "pages, filters and marks the pages shelf. \n",
      "Lets you \n",
      "break a view into a series of pages. \n",
      "So you can better analyze how a specific field \n",
      "affects the rest of the data in a view we'll \n",
      "use the filter shelf when working with \n",
      "filters and filtering our data. \n",
      "The marks shelf on the other hand contains \n",
      "functionalities related to coloring size \n",
      "labels and so on. \n",
      "This lesson was a quick overview of Tableau's \n",
      "interface. \n",
      "I am sure now you have a better idea of what \n",
      "you see in front of you. \n",
      "When you open the program in the lessons to \n",
      "come, we'll continue to explore Tableau's \n",
      "functionalities and you'll learn a ton about \n",
      "each of the buttons we mentioned here as of now, \n",
      "this will do. \n",
      "Thanks for watching. \n",
      "## Let's create our first chart in Tableau! \n",
      "All right, excellent. \n",
      "It is time to continue our adventure in \n",
      "Tableaux. \n",
      "In this lesson, we'll create our first \n",
      "visualization and it is going to be awesome \n",
      "ready. \n",
      "Let's get right into it. \n",
      "Then as you can see the workspace area is empty \n",
      "right now, \n",
      "we've already loaded the GDP data file and we \n",
      "can see that here. \n",
      "Actually, let's open the GDP data XL file for a \n",
      "second. \n",
      "I want to make sure you are familiar with its \n",
      "structure here. \n",
      "It is we have a few blank rows but tableau took \n",
      "care of them. \n",
      "Then we have a column with country names, a \n",
      "column indicating that this is \n",
      "GDP data and several columns with GDP figures \n",
      "for each of these \n",
      "countries. \n",
      "And this is the data sheet we are using right \n",
      "now. Perfect. \n",
      "Let's go back to tableaux. \n",
      "The way data is organized here is rather \n",
      "interesting. \n",
      "Our attention should be focused on the \n",
      "dimensions and measures part of the screen. \n",
      "First off, we notice that tableau has been very \n",
      "smart and managed to organize our \n",
      "data. \n",
      "Categorical variables are right here under \n",
      "dimensions. \n",
      "While numerical data such as the country's \n",
      "actual GDP is under measures dimensions have \n",
      "been colored in blue \n",
      "and measures are in green. OK. \n",
      "Another important remark we have to make is \n",
      "that some of the fields we see here are in \n",
      "italics and others aren't the distinction \n",
      "between the two is that tableau generates \n",
      "certain fields based on the data. \n",
      "It finds when tableau generates its own fields \n",
      "such as the measure names field we see here. \n",
      "These are fields that are not contained in \n",
      "our original data source, But tableaux deems \n",
      "that these can be useful and creates \n",
      "them for us. \n",
      "The same thing is true for latitude, \n",
      "longitude, number of records and measure values \n",
      "we see in green \n",
      "under measures. \n",
      "The rest of the fields written without italics \n",
      "are ones we saw in the XL file. \n",
      "We loaded country name, indicator name and the \n",
      "years from 2002 to \n",
      "2016 where we have country's GDP figures. Good. \n",
      "Another important detail I would like to \n",
      "mention is that tableaux adds an icon right \n",
      "next to each of the fields we have under \n",
      "dimensions and measures. \n",
      "This is what allows us to understand how \n",
      "tableau reads the data. \n",
      "The first field under dimensions is country \n",
      "name and its icon is the \n",
      "globe. \n",
      "Tableau recognizes that this field is related \n",
      "to actual countries and it is ready to help us \n",
      "out when we need to visualize such data. \n",
      "If I click on the icon, I'll be able to see \n",
      "that this is a string and that its \n",
      "geographic role is of country region as it \n",
      "should be. \n",
      "At the same time, the tiny ABC icon of the \n",
      "indicator name field shows us that \n",
      "this is a text value. \n",
      "And in fact, when I click on it, I can see that \n",
      "this is a string but different to what we have \n",
      "for the country name field. \n",
      "The geographic role of indicator name is none. \n",
      "That's because this is purely a text value. \n",
      "What about the year measures we have below? \n",
      "Well, these are numerical values, right? \n",
      "Therefore, it comes as no surprise that when we \n",
      "click on their icon, \n",
      "designating numerical values, we will see these \n",
      "are numbers. \n",
      "OK? Perfect. \n",
      "Let's do the following. \n",
      "I'll drag the country name field into the \n",
      "workspace area and boom \n",
      "Tableau created a world map that shows us the \n",
      "location of each of the countries we have in \n",
      "our data source. \n",
      "It is quite interesting to see that the field \n",
      "we see under columns and rows isn't country \n",
      "name but are artificially generated longitude \n",
      "and latitude fields. \n",
      "At first, it may seem strange but then when you \n",
      "think about it, \n",
      "it is intuitive. \n",
      "Tableau understands country name is a \n",
      "geographical field. \n",
      "This is why it will do much more than simply \n",
      "create a row or a column containing a list of \n",
      "the country we have in the Excel file. \n",
      "No, the program is smarter than that. \n",
      "It reads the country names and then creates the \n",
      "two fields, \n",
      "longitude and latitude in order to map each \n",
      "country geographically and hence the \n",
      "beautiful map we have here. \n",
      "Now, if I drag the year 2016 in the map, \n",
      "tableau will update the \n",
      "chart adding the 2016 GDP of each country. \n",
      "We can see that happen. \n",
      "If we hover above each of the dots we have \n",
      "representing the countries on our map. \n",
      "See the US GDP for 2016 was more than $18 \n",
      "trillion while Canada's GDP was around $1.5 \n",
      "trillion. \n",
      "OK. Perfect. \n",
      "Everything's good. \n",
      "Our first visualization and Tableau is almost \n",
      "ready. \n",
      "One last finishing touch I would like to add is \n",
      "to enlarge the bubbles a bit indicating how \n",
      "large a country's GDP is to \n",
      "do that. \n",
      "I can work with the newly appeared sum 2016 pan \n",
      "on the right side of the screen, I'll click on \n",
      "its tiny arrow and we'll select \n",
      "edit sizes, the edit sizes, dialog box allows \n",
      "me to enlarge the bubbles we see in \n",
      "the visualization. \n",
      "I think this will do let's click apply. \n",
      "And as you see the bubbles in the visualization \n",
      "increased. \n",
      "This makes it a bit easier to compare the GDP \n",
      "of different countries. \n",
      "The final touch will be to edit the name of \n",
      "this visualization. \n",
      "I'll double click here and simply type a title. \n",
      "Anything is better than sheet one. \n",
      "That's why I'll simply type GDP per country \n",
      "comparison. \n",
      "And here we are, that's our first visualization \n",
      "in Tableau and we are just getting \n",
      "started \n",
      " \n",
      "# Tableau Functionalities \n",
      "## Creating a table \n",
      "Ok, perfect. \n",
      "In this lesson, we'll continue exploring some \n",
      "of Tableau's main features in particular, we'll \n",
      "learn how to create a table with data \n",
      "and add some custom fields. \n",
      "The table we will create is going to be a \n",
      "pretty simple one, \n",
      "providing a monthly and yearly breakdown of a \n",
      "company's sales. \n",
      "As you can see, our original data source \n",
      "contains a column called period. \n",
      "This is where we have both yearly and monthly \n",
      "data. \n",
      "The first four characters designate the year \n",
      "when a sale was made and then the last two \n",
      "contain information about the month when the \n",
      "sale occurred. \n",
      "What I would like to do is split this \n",
      "information into two separate custom fields, \n",
      "year and month. \n",
      "The way to do that is to go to the analysis tab \n",
      "and create a calculated field, \n",
      "right? \n",
      "Once this dialog box opens, I'll type the name \n",
      "of the field I am creating which is year. \n",
      "Then I'll use the left function in order to \n",
      "take the four leftmost symbols of \n",
      "the period field. \n",
      "This is where we have the year when the sale \n",
      "occurred. \n",
      "Left is a function. \n",
      "Most of you are probably familiar with in \n",
      "Tableau. \n",
      "It works in the exact same way as it does. \n",
      "In Excel. \n",
      "For example, in our next lesson, we'll pay \n",
      "extra attention to the different types of \n",
      "operations you can do to create custom fields. \n",
      "OK? \n",
      "Tableau recognizes we are writing the left \n",

      "OK. \n",
      "Here we go. \n",
      "The typical Tableau operators you'll need to \n",
      "remember are plus for addition, \n",
      "minus for subtraction star for multiplication \n",
      "forward slash for division \n",
      "and carat for elevation alongside these, you'll \n",
      "probably need comparison operators \n",
      "such as equal, higher, then lower than higher \n",
      "or \n",
      "equal and different. \n",
      "Then the logical functions available in Tableau \n",
      "are like the ones we have in Excel and or and \n",
      "not a lot of the \n",
      "functions and symbols used in Excel can be used \n",
      "when creating a calculated field. \n",
      "So for example, some of the most commonly used \n",
      "functions are some for some \n",
      "average for average min and max allowing you to \n",
      "find the minimum and maximum \n",

      "Most number of characters within a string we've \n",

      "available in Excel Mid providing us characters \n",
      "that are in the middle of a text string, upper \n",
      "and lower allowing us to either convert it to \n",
      "all upper case characters or convert it to all \n",

      "Thanks for watching. \n",
      "## Creating a custom field and adding calculations to a table \n",
      "Right. \n",
      "So we are ready to go back to Tableaux and \n",
      "perform a few additional operations with the \n",
      "table we created earlier right now. \n",
      "It shows us the number of units sold by the \n",
      "firm in each month of 2016 and 2017. \n",
      "Let's change this measure. \n",
      "What I would like it to show us is the revenue \n",
      "the company generated during each of these \n",
      "periods. \n",
      "How can I do that? \n",
      "Well, it's fairly easy. \n",
      "Our source data contains information about \n",
      "price and tableaux counted. \n",
      "The number of units sold each row shows us a \n",
      "single car sale, right? \n",
      "Therefore, if we multiply the price field and \n",
      "the auto generated number of records \n",
      "field, we would obtain revenues. \n",
      "Do you agree? \n",
      "Ok, good. \n",
      "Let's do that. \n",
      "We already know how to create a calculated \n",
      "field. \n",
      "I'll name it revenue and we'll take advantage \n",
      "of Tableau's autocomplete suggestions by \n",
      "multiplying price and number of records. \n",
      "See as we said in our previous lesson, we can \n",
      "use the star operator to carry out a \n",
      "multiplication. \n",
      "One very useful feature you have probably \n",
      "noticed is that at the bottom of the screen \n",
      "tableau tells us whether the calculation we've \n",
      "entered is a valid one or not. \n",
      "Right now, my calculation is valid if I remove \n",
      "a few symbols tableau would indicate \n",
      "that the calculation contains errors. \n",
      "This is a good guiding light when we create a \n",
      "calculation, right. \n",
      "So this is our revenue field, \n",
      "we can easily substitute the number of records \n",
      "data in the table with it. \n",
      "All I have to do is drag the revenue field and \n",
      "position it over the number of records data \n",
      "tableau replaces the two fields. Perfect. \n",
      "An important metric contained in our source \n",
      "data is gross profit. \n",
      "By definition, revenue minus cogs equals gross \n",
      "profit. \n",
      "Currently, we have revenue and gross profit. \n",
      "Let's calculate cogs as the difference between \n",
      "the two. \n",
      "That's easy to do. \n",
      "All we have to do is use the minus operator. \n",
      "Nice. \n",
      "Let's order our table in the following way. \n",
      "First we'll have revenue then cogs and finally \n",
      "gross profit. \n",
      "I can do that by dragging and dropping the \n",
      "three fields within the table. \n",
      "Please note that their values appear in the \n",
      "measure values card on the left side of the \n",
      "workspace area, we can change their order \n",
      "either from here or directly inside the table. \n",
      "It's up to you. \n",
      "One more thing you have probably noticed the \n",
      "measure names field which appeared in the \n",
      "columns section. \n",
      "This is an auto generated field tableau uses in \n",
      "order to form our table and separate the \n",
      "names of different measures. \n",
      "If we were to remove it from the column section, \n",
      "the table will lose its shape and all three \n",
      "measures will be put together. \n",
      "Let's press control and Z and undo this action. \n",
      "OK. Excellent. \n",
      "In our next lesson, we'll learn how to add \n",
      "totals and subtotals to our tables in tableaux. \n",
      "This will do for now. \n",
      "Thanks for watching. \n",
      " \n",
      "## Adding totals and subtotals \n",
      "Most executives and by most, I mean, all of \n",
      "them prefer receiving tables that contain \n",
      "totals and subtotals. \n",
      "This makes it easier for them and helps them \n",
      "digest information in a faster way. \n",
      "In this lesson, we will learn how to add totals \n",
      "and subtotals to our tableau tables. \n",
      "That's nice because the table we have been \n",
      "working on in the last few videos doesn't \n",
      "contain totals for 2016 and 2017. \n",
      "We'll add them in this video. \n",
      "That's fairly easy to do. \n",
      "I'll go to analysis then totals and we'll \n",
      "select show column, \n",
      "grand totals. \n",
      "The totals we just added are for the entire \n",
      "period 2016 and 2017. \n",
      "That's not really useful. \n",
      "Is it whenever a person is interested in a \n",
      "company's sales or gross profit, they want to \n",
      "know how much it made in a specific year and \n",
      "whether it performed better than the year \n",
      "before a company will also want to know how its \n",
      "year's sales compare to other companies. \n",
      "So I'll go to analysis totals and unclick the \n",
      "show column, grand totals to remove the total. \n",
      "We just added what I can do differently. \n",
      "The second time around is opt for add all \n",
      "subtotals. \n",
      "And this will give me the total figures for \n",
      "2016 and 2017 \n",
      "separately. \n",
      "Quite nice. \n",
      "Right now, we can read the table easily the \n",
      "fictitious numbers we see here, \n",
      "help us compare 2016 and 2017 and give us a \n",
      "good idea of what the \n",
      "actual sales were for that period. \n",
      "In our next lesson, we'll add percentage, gross \n",
      "margin to our table. \n",
      "Thanks for watching. \n",
      " \n",
      "## Adding a custom calculation \n",
      "Ok, excellent. \n",
      "We're doing good. \n",
      "We've seen quite a few interesting tableau \n",
      "tools so far and we'll continue to do so during \n",
      "this lesson as well. \n",
      "Our table is almost ready. \n",
      "We have revenue cogs and gross profit. \n",
      "Now that I think about it, one thing we should \n",
      "probably add is a gross margin calculation \n",
      "right next to the gross profit figures. \n",
      "Gross margin is useful because it allows us to \n",
      "see what portion of revenues were converted \n",
      "into gross profit once we have considered the \n",
      "cost of goods sold. \n",
      "Right. \n",
      "Let's add a new calculated field. \n",
      "I'll name it GM percent. \n",
      "All we have to do is divide gross profits by \n",
      "revenue, right? \n",
      "And we already know how to do that. Ok. \n",
      "Here we are. \n",
      "We've calculated a new field. \n",
      "Let's add it to the table. \n",
      "I'll insert it in the measure values card there. \n",
      "I've added the new field right next to gross \n",
      "profit. \n",
      "But it looks strange, doesn't it? \n",
      "If we divide gross profit by revenues, we would \n",
      "usually expect a number in the region of 10, \n",
      "2030 or maybe 50%. \n",
      "Certainly not 1000. \n",
      "What is going on here when I divide 71 million \n",
      "by 244 million, \n",
      "which is what we have in January. \n",
      "I obtain 29%. \n",
      "Approximately. \n",
      "There are two possible explanations. \n",
      "Either tableau miscalculated, the simple \n",
      "division we asked it to perform or our formula \n",
      "is not 100%. OK. \n",
      "It's most likely us and not the computer, right. \n",
      "I'll take out the GM percent field from the \n",
      "measure values box and we'll edit the \n",
      "calculated field from here. \n",
      "What we forgot to do is type sum around the two \n",
      "variables. \n",
      "If we don't sum the variables, we are not \n",
      "dividing their total figures for each month. \n",
      "Let's adjust our calculated field in this way \n",
      "and see what happens. \n",
      "OK? \n",
      "This is a column with numbers that look like \n",
      "zeros, but perhaps these are percentage values. \n",
      "Let's change the way the GM percent \n",
      "column is displayed to do that. \n",
      "I'll simply click on the GM percent variable in \n",
      "the measure values card and select the format \n",
      "option. \n",
      "We have quite a few options available here. \n",
      "So I'll simply select a percentage format with \n",
      "one decimal place. \n",
      "Voila. \n",
      "Our table is ready in our next lesson. \n",
      "We'll add a filter that would allow us to \n",
      "choose whether to see both 2016 and 2017 \n",
      "values or just one at a time. \n",
      "See you there. \n",
      " \n",
      "## Inserting a filter \n",
      "One of the most interesting options available \n",
      "in tableaux is adding a filter to the \n",
      "visualization you are working on in this lesson, \n",
      "we'll learn how to do that. \n",
      "Of course, we'll add a filter to our table from \n",
      "a user standpoint. \n",
      "The only field which makes sense to be filtered \n",
      "in this table is the year field. \n",
      "A person could be interested in seeing numbers \n",
      "for 2016 or 2017 \n",
      "only. \n",
      "For example. \n",
      "So what I'll do is select the analysis tab and \n",
      "then select filters, \n",
      "choosing the year field. \n",
      "As we had already decided, \n",
      "we would like to create a filter for years. \n",
      "And as we do that, a filter appears on the \n",
      "right side of our workspace area. \n",
      "Now, we can easily hide 2017. \n",
      "For example, I'll simply untick its \n",
      "value and everything related to 2017 disappears \n",
      "from the sheet \n",
      "pretty cool. \n",
      "Right? \n",
      "Of course, we can do the same with 2016. \n",
      "I'll select 2017 and unti 2016. \n",
      "And here we are. \n",
      "When we click on the tiny arrow which is in the \n",
      "upper right corner of the filter pane, \n",
      "we find plenty of options that allow us to \n",
      "adjust the filter we've created. \n",
      "For example, we can change its appearance to \n",
      "single value list, \n",
      "representing radio buttons have a filter as a \n",
      "drop down menu, \n",
      "a multiple values list and so on and so forth. \n",
      "We can easily change the filters formatting by \n",
      "selecting format filters. \n",
      "Or alternatively, we change the filters title \n",
      "by clicking on the edit title button. \n",
      "What else can we do? \n",
      "Oh, yes. \n",
      "We can choose whether to apply the filter to \n",
      "the current working sheet only or to all \n",
      "worksheets in the tableau file we are working \n",
      "with. \n",
      "And that's really useful when working with \n",
      "several interrelated sheets. OK. \n",
      "This was our short introduction to filters in \n",
      "tableaux. \n",
      "This will do for now. \n",

      " \n",
      "## Working with joins in Tableau \n",
      "One of the most important aspects of your work \n",
      "in tableaux is the data source you are using to \n",
      "perform analysis quite often, the data will be \n",
      "stored in multiple locations and hence, \n",
      "you will have to deal with a number of data \n",
      "sources which live in different environments. \n",
      "Nevertheless, you are going to want to use all \n",
      "of the data available to you and run analysis \n",
      "on everything together. \n",
      "The way we merge multiple data sources is by \n",
      "using joins for those of you who have already \n",
      "followed our program and especially our SQL \n",
      "videos you'll be familiar with what follows in \n",
      "this video. \n",
      "So feel free to skip or continue watching as a \n",
      "refresher for the rest. \n",
      "Please follow along when we want to perform \n",
      "cross data table joins. \n",
      "We want to combine two or more data tables to \n",
      "create a unique database. \n",
      "How do we join separate data tables? \n",
      "Well, there are a few ways to do that. \n",
      "We can create an inner, outer left or a right \n",
      "joint. \n",
      "Let's open an Excel file to demonstrate a bit \n",
      "better what each type of joint represents. \n",
      "Here, we have two very simple tables. \n",
      "The first one shows us the age of three \n",
      "basketball players and the second one shows us \n",
      "the salary of basketball players. \n",
      "Please note that the two tables are different \n",
      "due to their last rows. \n",
      "We have lebron James in the first one and Kyrie \n",
      "Irving in the second. \n",
      "Ok, let's say we would like to run some \n",
      "analysis and use the data available in both \n",
      "tables. \n",
      "Therefore, as described earlier, we have to use \n",
      "joints. \n",
      "But how do we do that? \n",
      "We can easily see that the two tables have one \n",
      "column in common. \n",
      "The basketball player column, this column will \n",
      "serve as a key. \n",
      "When we put together the information from both \n",
      "tables, a left join would mean that the left \n",
      "column of the first table will lead the way we \n",
      "will use it to create a table containing \n",
      "age and salary information about the three \n",
      "players we see here. \n",
      "Whenever we find one of these players to the \n",
      "right, we'll add their salary in the new table. \n",
      "As you can see here if their name is not \n",
      "present to the right, \n",
      "which is the case with lebron james' salary, we \n",
      "will have a null value in the table. \n",
      "If a player's name is not present in the left \n",

      "which are not present in the key field of the \n",
      "left table are omitted in the new table. \n",
      "A right join functions. \n",
      "In the same way. \n",
      "However, this time, the left column of the \n",
      "second table leads the way Kyrie \n",
      "Irving replaces lebron James who is not present \n",
      "in the left table. \n",
      "Hence, the only missing value would be Kyrie \n",
      "Irving's age. \n",
      "Given that the only information we have about \n",
      "him is in the right table. \n",
      "The case when we are interested in the \n",
      "intersection of the two tables only is called \n",
      "an inner join. \n",
      "This is when we create a table that contains \n",

      "players. \n",
      "Hence, this is an inner join. \n",

      "# The Tableau Exercise \n",
      "## Introduction to the exercise \n",
      "Hello and welcome back. \n",
      "Now that we are nearly finished with our \n",
      "introduction to Tableau. \n",
      "It is time to start creating great looking \n",
      "charts and use them to build a complete \n",
      "dashboard. \n",
      "This is way more exciting than getting \n",
      "acquainted with Tableau's interface. \n",
      "Isn't it to do that? \n",
      "We'll solve a complete real life exercise and \n",
      "each lesson will build upon the previous one. \n",
      "Sounds great. Right. \n",
      "All right. \n",
      "Then let's get started. \n",
      "Here's the Excel data we'll use. \n",
      "It was provided by a company that has produced \n",
      "several audio books and has been selling them \n",
      "at an online marketplace. \n",
      "One of the main components of that marketplace \n",
      "is reviews. \n",
      "So we have two files, one about sales and \n",
      "another one containing information about \n",
      "reviews. \n",
      "Customers left for each audio book, \n",
      "both files contain the date when a purchase or \n",
      "a review occurred. \n",
      "It will be great if we manage to produce a \n",
      "table that takes advantage of both types of \n",
      "data we have when a person bought an audiobook \n",
      "and when and with which rating a \n",
      "person left a review. \n",
      "If we manage to do that, we'll be able to \n",
      "create several different charts in Tableau that \n",
      "would allow us to learn if the number of \n",
      "reviews the company receives has been growing. \n",
      "How did the average review score change over \n",
      "time? \n",
      "What is the percentage breakdown between 10 \n",
      "star, nine star, \n",
      "eight star and other types of reviews? \n",
      "What percentage of people acquiring an \n",
      "audiobook? \n",
      "Leave a review, visualize the correlation \n",
      "between audiobook sales and number of \n",
      "reviews or perhaps visualize the correlation \n",
      "between average review score and sales \n",
      "in the lessons to come. \n",
      "You'll see how to do all of that. \n",
      "Stay tuned and thanks for watching. \n",
      "## Let's create a dashboard - Visualizing the three charts we want to create \n",
      "All right, very good. \n",
      "Let's take a look at the following picture. \n",
      "This is where we want to get by the end of our \n",
      "exercise. \n",
      "Our goal is to create a dashboard containing \n",
      "three charts, \n",
      "a chart showing us the number of reviews with a \n",
      "second axis measuring the monthly average score. \n",
      "Then we would like to create a pie chart \n",
      "showing us the percentage of reviews each \n",
      "audiobook obtained. \n",
      "For example, 50% audiobook, \n",
      "1 25% audiobook, 2 10% audiobook three and so \n",
      "on. \n",
      "And finally, we would like to create a chart \n",
      "that gives us information about the ratio \n",
      "between reviews left and the number of \n",
      "audiobook purchases. \n",
      "Such a visualization would help us understand \n",
      "what portion of people buying an audiobook, \n",
      "listen to it and then leave a review. Ok. \n",
      "These three charts will be the foundation of \n",
      "the dashboard we will create later on. \n",
      "And I've added a note on the side showing us \n",
      "that once the dashboard is ready, \n",
      "we will be able to look at the aggregate data \n",
      "or use a filter to monitor the performance of \n",
      "individual audio books. \n",
      "Sounds exciting, right? \n",
      "As a side note here, I would like to add that \n",
      "in general, \n",
      "it is a good practice to sit down and design \n",
      "your dashboards before you start working in \n",
      "tableaux. \n",
      "This allows you to have a predefined idea of \n",
      "what you would like to achieve and to check \n",
      "whether you are able to do that at the end. \n",
      "Moreover, and what is probably most important, \n",
      "this allows you to think what visualizations \n",
      "make sense from a business perspective. \n",
      "OK, great. \n",
      "Let's get right into it in our next lesson. \n",
      "## Using Joins in Tableau \n",
      "As usual. \n",
      "The first thing we need to do when starting a \n",
      "new project is load our data. \n",
      "Our two source files are audiobook reviews and \n",
      "audiobook sales. \n",
      "Let's connect them to Tableau. \n",
      "Here's the audio book reviews file in the same \n",
      "folder. \n",
      "We also have the audiobook sales file. \n",
      "We'll need both. \n",
      "So I'll click on add and we'll load the other \n",
      "files too in order to be able to use the \n",
      "information of both tables at the same time, \n",
      "we'll have to combine them somehow to do that. \n",
      "We must double click at the audiobook \n",
      "sales gray button that is in front of us. \n",
      "Then we can drag the audiobook reviews \n",
      "table from the sheets field on the left. \n",
      "We've just created the join. \n",
      "We need excellent what we want to obtain by \n",
      "doing that is a unique table containing \n",
      "information about all transactions for all \n",
      "audio books and the respective reviews left by \n",
      "clients whenever they chose to do so, \n",
      "the transaction ID column is the perfect link \n",
      "between the two files as it is available \n",
      "in both. \n",
      "And it could serve as a common field based on \n",
      "which we could link the two tables together. \n",
      "So one of the main aspects we'll explore in \n",
      "this lesson is how to create a connection \n",
      "between two tables in tableaux. \n",
      "Please remember that we will distinguish the \n",
      "terms data connection and table connection. \n",
      "Table connection is performed by \n",
      "functionalities like joining or blending. \n",
      "It refers to combining data from two or more \n",
      "data sources. \n",
      "Data connection instead represents a single \n",
      "data source connection between Tableau \n",
      "and a data source such as an Excel workbook or \n",
      "an SQL database. \n",
      "When we imported the second file Tableau did \n",
      "some work for us in the background and created \n",
      "a connection between the two files. \n",
      "The symbol you see here is an indication we've \n",
      "created an inner join. \n",
      "Technically speaking, when creating a join, \n",
      "Tableau sends a query to the database, \n",
      "the joint is implemented on the relevant tables \n",
      "at the database level and the output of the \n",
      "operation is brought back to Tableau where it \n",
      "is ready to be used for analysis. \n",
      "And inner join means that the two tables we've \n",
      "added have a field in common and we \n",
      "can combine them using that field. \n",
      "Let me hover my mouse over the symbol tableau \n",
      "indicates that it has created an inner \n",
      "join using the parameter audiobook name. \n",
      "We don't want that. \n",
      "We want to link the two tables according to the \n",
      "transaction id parameter. \n",
      "As our analysis will be focused on user sales \n",
      "and reviews. \n",
      "So I'll click on the inner join symbol and \n",
      "we'll open the join menu first \n",
      "off. \n",
      "Let me substitute the field we use. \n",
      "In order to create a connection between the two \n",
      "tables, I would like to create a connection \n",
      "using the transaction ID field. \n",
      "And here we are, here's a preview of the table \n",
      "we've created through an inner join and \n",
      "transaction ID as the primary key as shown in \n",
      "the diagram. \n",
      "When we create an interj join between the two \n",
      "tables, we consider their intersection the \n",
      "situation where the primary key is found in \n",
      "both tables. \n",
      "To give you an example, if a person who has a \n",
      "given transaction ID purchased a course \n",
      "but did not leave a review, then they won't be \n",
      "included in this table. \n",
      "And inner join would require users who have \n",
      "purchased a course to have left a rating \n",
      "and both the date of purchase and the date when \n",
      "the rating was posted to be known. \n",
      "Basically, it contains only the rows in which \n",
      "we have a transaction ID, \n",
      "a date of purchase, a date of review, a review \n",
      "rating and information regarding which was the \n",
      "audio book that was purchased and rated. \n",
      "For example, all the cases when a person bought \n",
      "an audio book but did not rate, \n",
      "it are not considered. \n",
      "Do you think this information is important? \n",
      "Do we want to be able to understand how reviews \n",
      "impacted sales and whether we can see a \n",
      "pattern in total purchases with respect to \n",
      "reviews? \n",
      "Of course, we'll need this information. \n",
      "And if we use an inner join, we are not going \n",
      "to have it. \n",
      "Therefore, we'll need a different type of join. \n",
      "One that includes the information about \n",
      "purchases and people who did not rate an audio \n",
      "book. \n",
      "So looking at the tiny diagram we have here, \n",
      "I am going to select a left join. \n",
      "Given that the audiobook sales file is on the \n",
      "left side. \n",
      "We want to have a table that contains \n",
      "information regarding audiobook purchases, \n",
      "all of the audiobook purchases. \n",
      "And the case is when people who bought these \n",
      "books provided a rating and a left join is more \n",
      "suitable than an inner join in \n",
      "this case. \n",
      "Ok, great. \n",
      "In our next lesson, we'll make a check to see \n",
      "whether the data we've connected to Tableau is \n",
      "correct. \n",
      "This will do for now. \n",
      "## Performing a Numbers Check - Attempt #1 \n",
      "Right. \n",
      "Our pace is excellent. \n",
      "In this lesson, we would like to make sure that \n",
      "the data we've loaded through a join is truly \n",
      "representative of the figures we have in the \n",
      "two source files, \n",
      "right? \n",
      "Let's open sheet one and do a few checks. \n",
      "First off, I would like to see how many sales \n",
      "transactions were registered in total. \n",
      "Let's drag the number of records field into the \n",
      "workspace area. \n",
      "Tableau is really quick and tells us that there \n",
      "are 110,570 rows \n",
      "with transaction ID information. \n",
      "These are the actual sales of audio books that \n",
      "occurred throughout the entire period of \n",
      "analysis. \n",
      "A quick look into the sales Excel file shows us \n",
      "that this number is precisely the one we should \n",
      "have. \n",
      "Ok, let's change the format of the date of \n",
      "purchase field to date, \n",
      "shall we? \n",
      "I like it much better up here among the \n",
      "dimensions fields and with a calendar icon \n",
      "right next to it, \n",
      "suggesting this is a date field. \n",
      "Next, I'll test for the number of ratings we \n",
      "have in the reviews file. \n",
      "I'll simply drop the ratings field into the \n",
      "workspace area and the result we have is \n",
      "96,897 which is too high. \n",
      "Why is that? \n",
      "Well, we are summing not counting, \n",
      "this is the actual sum of all ratings that have \n",
      "been left by students. \n",
      "We want to count the number of ratings instead. \n",
      "Here, that's much better. \n",
      "People who bought our audio books left a total \n",
      "of 10,798 ratings. \n",
      "Let's make sure that this number is fine as \n",
      "well. \n",
      "Ok, here it is very well. \n",
      "One final check and we are good to go. \n",
      "Let's add the date of purchase field to the \n",
      "columns of our workspace. \n",
      "Moreover, I'll increase the level of \n",
      "granularity of our data and we'll opt for a \n",
      "monthly breakdown. \n",
      "That's something we can do fairly easily and is \n",
      "one of Tableau's strongest features. \n",
      "Granularity is a term that you will encounter \n",
      "quite often while working with Tableau. \n",
      "It is very important to understand what it is \n",
      "used for. \n",
      "In fact, it simply refers to the following the \n",
      "level of detail in a field of a data set. \n",
      "In our example, this means taking a daily, \n",
      "weekly, monthly or yearly \n",
      "breakdown are all different levels of \n",
      "granularity of the date of purchase field of \n",
      "the audiobook sales data source. \n",
      "Here's the monthly breakdown of reviews. \n",
      "Wait, there is something strange according to \n",
      "Tableau, we did not receive any \n",
      "reviews in December 2017. \n",
      "However, I do know for a fact that we did. \n",
      "Here's the proof in our Excel file. \n",
      "What happened? \n",
      "Tableau gets confused pretty easily when we \n",
      "join the data and then use a dimension \n",
      "such as purchase date from the sales file and \n",
      "another field such as rating from the reviews \n",
      "file. \n",
      "For some reason, the date fields of the two \n",
      "tables we joined do not match up with each \n",
      "other correctly. \n",
      "Whenever you experience such issues, it is best \n",
      "to use data blending and alternative to \n",
      "tableau joints. \n",
      "That's precisely what we will do in our next \n",
      "lesson. \n",
      "Thanks for watching. \n",
      "## Blending Data in Tableau \n",
      "Data blending is a method of combining data \n",
      "that supplements a table of data from one data \n",
      "source with columns of data from another data \n",
      "source. \n",
      "In our case, we would combine the sales data \n",
      "from the audiobook sales file with the \n",
      "ratings column from the audiobook reviews file. \n",
      "How does blending differ from joining? \n",
      "You can think of a data blend as a specific \n",
      "type of left joint that is preferable or \n",
      "necessary to be applied depending on various \n",
      "conditions. \n",
      "Sometimes using a joint will do a perfect job \n",
      "while in other situations blending will either \n",
      "deliver better or quicker results or be the \n",
      "only solution. \n",
      "Moreover joining data is something you do \n",
      "manually. \n",
      "Whereas data blending is a functionality that \n",
      "tableau implements automatically \n",
      "while you are working on your sheet. \n",
      "This makes it a more intuitive feature to use \n",
      "provided that the following conditions are met. \n",
      "Both data tables are separate data sources. \n",
      "There is a field that serves as the connection \n",
      "between them and would allow us to carry out \n",
      "queries that leverage information from both \n",
      "tables. \n",
      "So one of the preliminary basic requirements to \n",
      "blend data in tablet is to have a common field \n",
      "creating the connection between the two \n",
      "data tables. \n",
      "From a technical perspective. \n",
      "What blending does is take separate query \n",
      "results from each data source and \n",
      "aggregate them in the view that is in Tableau \n",
      "only then it will \n",
      "connect and join the query results on the same \n",
      "common field which should contain information \n",
      "of the same data type. \n",
      "This is different from the case when you are \n",
      "using a joint where the aggregation is \n",
      "happening at the database level and just the \n",
      "output of the joint is being brought back to \n",
      "tableau when blending, the aggregation occurs \n",
      "in tableau. \n",
      "So what are the benefits of blending data? \n",
      "It turns out that joining or blending can bring \n",
      "different results. \n",
      "And here is the tricky part. \n",
      "If you join two data tables containing \n",
      "duplicate values that are not aggregated \n",
      "properly in while doing some preliminary work \n",
      "on the data, you will obtain an artificially \n",
      "inflated data set in tableaux \n",
      "blending solves that problem automatically \n",
      "tableau will consider the level of granularity \n",
      "you have chosen in the view in other words, in \n",
      "your sheet and will combine the data sources \n",
      "with aggregated fields directly. \n",
      "OK? \n",
      "I think we are ready to create an actual blend \n",
      "in tableaux. \n",
      "Let's open the audiobook sales file first. \n",
      "Then once I've opened the file, I'll open a \n",
      "sheet and click on new data source from the \n",
      "data tab. \n",
      "This is how we will create a new data \n",
      "connection and we load both files at the same \n",
      "time without creating a joint. \n",
      "As we can see here, both files are open in \n",
      "Tableau to make sure we've created a blend. \n",
      "I can open the edit relationships, dialogue box \n",
      "and see whether tableaux has created a \n",
      "connection between the two files. \n",
      "In our case, things are pretty straightforward \n",
      "because Tableau immediately recognized that the \n",
      "two files contain columns with the same name, \n",
      "transaction ID. \n",
      "The primary data source is the audiobook sales \n",
      "file which is excellent. \n",
      "This means it would represent the left table of \n",
      "the left join performed while blending the \n",
      "data tableaux. \n",
      "Or alternatively, the view will use all rows \n",
      "from audiobook sales audiobook review instead \n",
      "acts as a secondary data \n",
      "source, the right table. \n",
      "Therefore, while blending tableau will use the \n",
      "aggregated rows from this data source based on \n",
      "the dimension of the common fields. \n",
      "For the sake of exercise. \n",
      "Let's select the custom relationship radio \n",
      "button and choose not one but two different \n",
      "fields that serve as the connection between the \n",

      "So we can forget about that problem. \n",

      "chart that shows the number of reviews and the \n",
      "average review score per month displayed on a \n",
      "secondary axis. \n",
      "So I'll add the rating field to rose for the \n",

      "But this time we want the average of these \n",
      "numbers and we would like to create a dual axis. \n",
      "Excellent. \n",
      "Obviously, we will have to fine tune the axis \n",
      "scale. \n",
      "A bit as right now, the chart doesn't show a \n",
      "match. \n",
      "I'll simply double click and choose a fixed \n",
      "range starting from eight and going all the way \n",
      "up to 10, \n",
      "which is the maximum review score we can have. \n",
      "However, right now, the two charts overlap in a \n",
      "strange way and we are unable to see their \n",
      "trends. \n",
      "So I'll increase the size of the axis to 12 and \n",
      "we'll change the full color of both variables, \n",
      "number of ratings and average ratings. \n",
      "That's easy to do. \n",
      "I need to select one of the two variables and \n",
      "then click on the color button under marks. \n",
      "Once we've opened the edit colors menu, we can \n",
      "choose which variables color we would like to \n",
      "change to a color. \n",
      "We like better. \n",
      "I like yellow and blue. Awesome. \n",
      "I'm not really a fan of opacity which adds a \n",
      "transparency effect and sort of mixes the \n",
      "colors we have in our chart. \n",
      "Therefore, I'll opt for 100% opacity for both \n",
      "variables. \n",
      "See the chart looks nicer. \n",
      "Let's edit its axis again. \n",
      "That's something which is quite easy to do. \n",
      "We have to double click on a specific axis and \n",
      "type the axis title we would like to have, \n",
      "I'll change counter rating to number of ratings, \n",
      "month of review date, \n",
      "two month. \n",
      "And I believe the average rating doesn't need \n",
      "to be changed. \n",
      "Very good. \n",
      "This is our first chart. \n",
      "Does it give us any meaningful information? \n",
      "Well, yes, I believe it does. \n",
      "First off, we can see that the number of \n",
      "reviews left by people has been increasing, \n",
      "which is pretty great. \n",
      "The average review score is almost nine and \n",
      "sometimes even higher than nine, \n",
      "which is a pretty high score but should be \n",
      "interpreted. \n",
      "And compared with the rest of the market. \n",
      "Moreover, we don't see a dependence between \n",
      "number of reviews and average ratings, \n",
      "which means that average review scores are not \n",
      "influenced by the number of people leaving \n",
      "reviews. \n",
      "All of this is quite interesting. \n",
      "Let's keep up the good work we have been doing \n",

      "second chart for our dashboard. \n",
      "Thanks for watching. \n",
      "## Second chart \n",
      "Hi and welcome back in this video. \n",
      "We'll create the second chart which will be \n",
      "part of our dashboard a pie chart showing the \n",
      "percentage of the total reviews that each \n",
      "audiobook obtained. \n",
      "The number of reviews is quite important in the \n",
      "marketplace we are studying and this is the \n",
      "reason why we are interested in finding out \n",
      "which audiobooks collected more reviews and \n",
      "alternative visualization would be a pie chart \n",
      "showing us the percentage of people who \n",
      "purchased a given audio book. Ok. \n",
      "Given that we know what we would like to \n",
      "accomplish things should be easier, right? \n",
      "I'll add the rating field to the workspace area. \n",
      "The number we obtained is the sum for all \n",
      "ratings. \n",
      "Let's use count for this measure. Perfect. \n",
      "The total number of reviews is \n",
      "10,798. \n",
      "And we know for a fact that that is true. \n",
      "Let's go ahead and add the audiobook names \n",
      "dimension above the rating field, shall we? \n",
      "This creates a breakdown by audiobook exactly \n",
      "what we want to have. \n",
      "Now, I can simply select the pie chart icon \n",
      "within the show me functionality and I'll \n",
      "create a pie chart, a really tiny one but still \n",
      "a pie chart to increase the charts \n",
      "size. \n",
      "I can simply click anywhere in the workspace \n",
      "area, hold the control key and then use the \n",
      "arrow keys. \n",
      "If I press control and up the chart grows \n",
      "vertically while control and right \n",
      "arrow increases the charts size horizontally, \n",
      "the opposite is true as well. \n",
      "We can decrease the charts size by pressing \n",
      "control and down key or control and left \n",
      "arrow. Awesome. \n",
      "What else we need labels? \n",
      "Right? \n",
      "Otherwise, it is difficult to gain an idea what \n",
      "portion of overall reviews a specific \n",
      "audiobook accounted for. \n",
      "I'll drag the rating field in label and a \n",
      "number of reviews appears right next to each \n",
      "audio book. \n",
      "Again, we need the count of ratings and not the \n",
      "sum. \n",
      "Ok. \n",
      "But how do we display these as a percentage? \n",
      "That's not that difficult. \n",
      "Actually, all I have to do is go to analysis, \n",
      "select percentage of and then click on table. \n",
      "Boom. \n",
      "Here we are. \n",
      "These are the percentages each audiobook \n",
      "accounted for among the total number of reviews, \n",
      "the pie charts and the labels we added shows us \n",
      "that audio books, one and two accounted for \n",
      "more than 50% of the total number of \n",
      "reviews the company received. \n",
      "Very interesting. \n",
      "The business relies greatly on these best \n",
      "sellers. \n",
      "In our next lesson. \n",
      "We'll create the third and final chart that \n",
      "would allow us to complete our initial plan and \n",
      "obtain the dashboard we intended from the very \n",
      "beginning \n",
      "## Third Chart \n",
      "Ok, we are almost there ready for chart number \n",
      "three. \n",
      "I hope you are. \n",
      "Here we go. \n",
      "In this lesson. \n",
      "We would like to create a chart that gives us \n",
      "information about the ratio between reviews \n",
      "left and the number of audiobook \n",
      "purchases in a given month. \n",
      "An important KP I showing us whether people who \n",
      "buy audiobooks leave reviews to do that. \n",
      "We'll need to create a few calculated fields. \n",
      "First, let's create a field which counts the \n",
      "number of ratings, \n",
      "not the sum of all ratings, but their count. \n",
      "It will be much easier if we create this field \n",
      "and use it going forward. \n",
      "The name of the field we are creating is number \n",
      "of ratings and I simply need to use the \n",
      "count function. \n",
      "The next calculated field I would like to \n",
      "create is number of purchases. \n",
      "Let's change the data source. \n",
      "We've selected to audiobook sales here. \n",
      "I will create a field called number of \n",
      "purchases which will contain the number of \n",
      "audiobook sales the company made. \n",
      "How do I count the number of purchases? \n",
      "Well, the transaction ID code is unique, right? \n",
      "If we count it, we should obtain the number of \n",
      "sales transactions which is precisely what we \n",
      "are looking for. \n",
      "Ok, good. \n",
      "We are almost ready now, we can create the last \n",
      "calculated field which will be the ratio \n",
      "between reviews and new purchases. \n",
      "Let's do that. \n",
      "It is a fairly easy task given that we've \n",
      "already created the number of reviews and the \n",
      "number of purchases all we have to do is divide \n",
      "the two figures and we'll obtain the measure we \n",
      "want to plot from the very beginning. \n",
      "Let's add it to the rows of our visualization. \n",
      "The result is a pretty nice bar chart which is \n",
      "a bit too large but still looks meaningful. \n",
      "It appears that the ratio of ratings to new \n",
      "students was significantly lower in November \n",
      "2017 and way higher the month before three \n",
      "times lower to be precise. \n",
      "I am sure the firm's Business intelligence team \n",
      "would want to have a look at that and analyze \n",
      "what the reason is for this. \n",
      "Let's quickly edit the title of the horizontal \n",
      "axis to month and save our work \n",

      "## Creating and Formatting a Dashboard \n",
      "Congratulations on making it this far in our \n",
      "Tableau training. \n",
      "Let's take a moment to see how much we have \n",
      "covered to this point. \n",
      "We started off by learning when and how Tableau \n",
      "can be useful in corporate decision making and \n",
      "learned how to install Tableau's free version \n",
      "Tableau public. \n",
      "We then learned how to connect data to Tableau \n",
      "and what we can do with the different parts of \n",
      "the Tableau interface. \n",
      "Not long after we created your first Tableau \n",
      "chart, we learned how to duplicate sheets \n",
      "and how to create tables. \n",
      "Then we learned how to create custom fields in \n",
      "order to manipulate our data within tableau \n",
      "easily. \n",
      "In addition, we learned how to add totals and \n",
      "sub totals to our tables and how to work with \n",
      "filters. \n",
      "We explored functionalities allowing us to work \n",
      "with multiple data sources such as joins and \n",
      "data blending. \n",
      "And most recently, we created three meaningful \n",
      "charts. \n",
      "Now we are going to build our dashboard which \n",
      "will be the last piece of the puzzle really. \n",
      "It will be interesting to put all three charts \n",
      "right next to each other and see the type of \n",
      "insights we can get by analyzing them in one \n",
      "place. \n",
      "OK. \n",
      "Let's get right into it to create a new \n",
      "dashboard. \n",
      "I'll click on the tiny icon we have here. \n",
      "See when we hover the mouse over it, it starts \n",
      "displaying new dashboard. \n",
      "Once the dashboard has been created, my first \n",
      "task would be to modify its size right now. \n",
      "It is a bit too small, isn't it? \n",
      "I can adjust the size settings from the left \n",
      "part of the dashboard screen. \n",
      "Let's work with a range that is 1000 pixels \n",
      "wide and has a height of 800 pixels. \n",
      "I hope you are watching this video from a large \n",
      "screen. \n",
      "OK. \n",
      "Let's drag and drop the three charts. \n",
      "All I have to do is drag them and place each \n",
      "chart where I want it. \n",
      "Tableau is quite smart and manages to find \n",
      "space and guesses what we want to do when \n",
      "we position the cursor above the dashboard area. \n",
      "Of course, there are a few things that need to \n",
      "be adjusted. \n",
      "I'll remove the legends. \n",
      "We don't need leaving the audiobooks legend. \n",
      "Only moreover, I would like to place the \n",
      "audiobook legend below the pie chart. \n",
      "It belongs to this way. \n",
      "What we are doing will be much clearer. \n",
      "I'll simply press on the legend and then grab \n",
      "the part you see here, \n",
      "dragging it below the pie chart. \n",
      "Let's resize a bit to get rid of the arrows. \n",
      "Perfect. \n",
      "Now, to remove the arrows of the pie chart and \n",
      "fit it in its allocated space without any \n",
      "problems we'll need to adjust its size from the \n",
      "chart to sheet. \n",
      "Let's go there and reduce the pie charts size \n",
      "just a tiny bit horizontally and vertically \n",
      "and then we can go back to the dashboard sheet \n",
      "and see what happened. \n",
      "Ok, great. \n",
      "The arrows disappeared. \n",
      "We are one step closer. \n",
      "Let's change the chart titles a bit because \n",
      "frankly, they don't mean that much. \n",
      "We should have done it earlier, but better late \n",
      "than never. \n",
      "Right. \n",
      "A good title for the first chart would be \n",
      "number of reviews and average rating. \n",
      "Also, I would like to adjust its font size to \n",
      "11 and put the text in bold. \n",
      "We'll do the same for the other charts too in \n",
      "order to be consistent, \n",
      "which is quite important. \n",
      "When building a dashboard, \n",
      "the title of the pie chart would be number of \n",
      "reviews by audiobook, \n",
      "as promised, I'll apply a font size of 11 and a \n",
      "bold text effect. \n",
      "And lastly, the title of the third chart will \n",
      "be ratio of reviews to sales \n",
      "very well. \n",
      "Our dashboard is almost ready in our next \n",

this lesson, we'll be creating our\\nfirst sheet.\\nIt's really easy to do and resembles how we\\ncreate a sheet in Excel or pretty much\\nevery other spreadsheet software.\\nAll I have to do is click here and a new sheet\\nwill be created, right?\\nThis is what a Tableau sheet looks like.\\nWe can have as many of them as we want.\\nI can simply click on this little icon at the\\nbottom and a new worksheet is added.\\nThe other two icons which are next to it are\\nfor creating a new dashboard and a new\\nstory.\\nWe'll deal with dashboards further in the\\ncourse.\\nSo we won't use these buttons for now.\\nOK.\\nLet's give some structure to what you are\\nseeing here.\\nIf this software is new to you,\\nthings can be a bit confusing.\\nSo it will be best if we spend a few minutes.\\nThe remainder of this lesson talking you\\nthrough Tableau's interface.\\nFirst off, we have 10 different tabs on\\nTableau's default ribbon.\\nThese are file data worksheet dashboard,\\nstory analysis map format window\\nand help.\\nLet's quickly go through each of them.\\nAs with most programs, the file tab contains\\ncertain functionalities related to opening,\\nclosing and saving files if you would like to,\\nyou can also exit tableau from here.\\nBut why would you want to do that data?\\nOn the other hand is where you will find\\nfunctionalities related to the data source you\\nare using here,\\nyou can add a new data connection, replace an\\nexisting one or simply edit the data\\nsource of the worksheet you are working with.\\nNext, we have the worksheet tab.\\nIt can be helpful when we want to create a new\\nworksheet hide or show a charts,\\ntitle caption summary and so on.\\nI am sure you noticed that we already created a\\nnew sheet with the little icon we have at the\\nbottom left corner of the sheet and we can do\\nthe same thing from the worksheet tab as well.\\nSuch repetition is common for most programs,\\nfunctionalities available in the ribbon\\ncan be accessed in other ways too.\\nIn fact, I rarely use the ribbon\\nfunctionalities, but it is good to have an\\noverview and be aware that they are there.\\nOK?\\nNext, we have the dashboard and story tabs.\\nAs I said, we'll learn more about dashboards\\nand stories later on.\\nIn the course, the analysis tab is where you\\ncan tweak your visualization in terms of\\nlabels, show figures as a percentage of the\\ntotal add trend lines,\\nlegends filters and more.\\nWe'll explore many of these options later in\\nthe course for now,\\nyou can remember that here, we have some\\ninteresting functionalities related to the way\\nwe perform our analysis.\\nAnd some of the tools we'll incorporate in it\\nmap is a tab that is helpful when we use\\nTableau's geographic visualization capabilities.\\nPretty soon.\\nYou will see that this is one of the most\\npowerful and impressive tableau features.\\nOf course, format can help us adjust the way\\nour visualization appears from here.\\nWe can modify its font, font size, axis,\\nbackgrounds,\\nlabels, size and so much more.\\nThat's another tab containing plenty of useful\\nfunctionalities.\\nWe'll explore later windows and help are two of\\nthe standard tabs we find in most\\nprograms.\\nSo I am not going to spend much time on them\\nalso because we are not going to use them\\nthroughout the course.\\nHowever, one thing we should mention is that\\nTableau public has a nice and open community of\\nusers who will be able to help you and whose\\nwork you can look at if needed,\\nall users of Tableau public who save their work,\\nmake it publicly available.\\nTherefore, this can be a useful place where you\\ncan search for a given issue you need help with\\nand see what comes up.\\nSo if I click on community and search for\\ngeography, I'll be able to see the\\nwork other users have saved previously, right?\\nThis is Tableau's ribbon\\nbelow the ribbon, we have several buttons that\\ncan be quite helpful.\\nThe show start page button takes us to the\\nscreen we saw previously when we connected\\ntableaux and our GDP data Excel file to get\\nback to the sheet that was created earlier.\\nI'll click here.\\nI'm sure you know how to work with undo and\\nredo.\\nSo if I were to drag one of the fields here, I\\ncan go back and undo this section with\\nundo.\\nOf course, see undone.\\nMost of the typical windows shortcuts can be\\nused here as well as you probably know.\\nThe shortcut for undo is control Z.\\nOn the right, we have other useful buttons such\\nas save,\\nallowing you to save the progress of your work.\\nQuite intuitively.\\nNew data source opens the connect functionality\\nwe saw earlier.\\nThe other buttons we have here are new\\nworksheet, clears,\\nsheet swap rows and columns, sort and so on.\\nWe'll explore many of these throughout the\\ncourse for now,\\nit would be best if you simply gain an idea how\\nvarious objects are positioned within Tableau's\\ninterface. OK.\\nOn the left side of Tableau's screen,\\nwe have two pas data and analytics.\\nThe data pane is quite important.\\nIt shows us what data we've loaded and then\\nTableau classifies the data into two\\ntypes dimensions and measures to put it\\nslightly differently.\\nThis is a distinction between categorical and\\nnumerical data.\\nThe data in the dimensions field cannot be\\naggregated.\\nIt is qualitative in nature.\\nQuite the opposite measures can be aggregated\\nand are quantitative in nature.\\nIn the next few lessons, we'll learn how to\\nwork with these fields.\\nBut for now, it would be nice if I just show\\nyou that we can drag dimensions and measures\\ninto the work area and use them to create our\\nvisualizations there.\\nThe work area is where we'll create our\\nvisualizations, dashboards and stories and\\nthis is one way to create a chart.\\nI am sure you noticed that the columns and rows,\\npart of the sheet started showing us the\\nvariables we've added to the workspace area.\\nWe'll explore this part of the interface in a\\nseparate video in a few lessons.\\nOK. Perfect.\\nWhat else do we have the show me button on the\\nright, which allows us to adjust the type of\\nvisualization we use.\\nIt is a very cool feature because tableau tells\\nus what types of visualizations we can\\nchoose from as not all charts will be available\\ndepending on the data we have chosen to work\\nwith.\\nOnce we decide we would like to switch to a\\ndifferent chart, all we need to do is select\\nthe respective type of chart and tableau makes\\nthe adjustment for us neat, right?\\nAnd finally, here in the middle, we have three\\nimportant sections,\\npages, filters and marks the pages shelf.\\nLets you\\nbreak a view into a series of pages.\\nSo you can better analyze how a specific field\\naffects the rest of the data in a view we'll\\nuse the filter shelf when working with\\nfilters and filtering our data.\\nThe marks shelf on the other hand contains\\nfunctionalities related to coloring size\\nlabels and so on.\\nThis lesson was a quick overview of Tableau's\\ninterface.\\nI am sure now you have a better idea of what\\nyou see in front of you.\\nWhen you open the program in the lessons to\\ncome, we'll continue to explore Tableau's\\nfunctionalities and you'll learn a ton about\\neach of the buttons we mentioned here as of now,\\nthis will do.\\nThanks for watching.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'Section Title': 'Introduction to Tableau', 'Course Title': \"Let's create our first chart in Tableau!\"}, page_content=\"All right, excellent.\\nIt is time to continue our adventure in\\nTableaux.\\nIn this lesson, we'll create our first\\nvisualization and it is going to be awesome\\nready.\\nLet's get right into it.\\nThen as you can see the workspace area is empty\\nright now,\\nwe've already loaded the GDP data file and we\\ncan see that here.\\nActually, let's open the GDP data XL file for a\\nsecond.\\nI want to make sure you are familiar with its\\nstructure here.\\nIt is we have a few blank rows but tableau took\\ncare of them.\\nThen we have a column with country names, a\\ncolumn indicating that this is\\nGDP data and several columns with GDP figures\\nfor each of these\\ncountries.\\nAnd this is the data sheet we are using right\\nnow. Perfect.\\nLet's go back to tableaux.\\nThe way data is organized here is rather\\ninteresting.\\nOur attention should be focused on the\\ndimensions and measures part of the screen.\\nFirst off, we notice that tableau has been very\\nsmart and managed to organize our\\ndata.\\nCategorical variables are right here under\\ndimensions.\\nWhile numerical data such as the country's\\nactual GDP is under measures dimensions have\\nbeen colored in blue\\nand measures are in green. OK.\\nAnother important remark we have to make is\\nthat some of the fields we see here are in\\nitalics and others aren't the distinction\\nbetween the two is that tableau generates\\ncertain fields based on the data.\\nIt finds when tableau generates its own fields\\nsuch as the measure names field we see here.\\nThese are fields that are not contained in\\nour original data source, But tableaux deems\\nthat these can be useful and creates\\nthem for us.\\nThe same thing is true for latitude,\\nlongitude, number of records and measure values\\nwe see in green\\nunder measures.\\nThe rest of the fields written without italics\\nare ones we saw in the XL file.\\nWe loaded country name, indicator name and the\\nyears from 2002 to\\n2016 where we have country's GDP figures. Good.\\nAnother important detail I would like to\\nmention is that tableaux adds an icon right\\nnext to each of the fields we have under\\ndimensions and measures.\\nThis is what allows us to understand how\\ntableau reads the data.\\nThe first field under dimensions is country\\nname and its icon is the\\nglobe.\\nTableau recognizes that this field is related\\nto actual countries and it is ready to help us\\nout when we need to visualize such data.\\nIf I click on the icon, I'll be able to see\\nthat this is a string and that its\\ngeographic role is of country region as it\\nshould be.\\nAt the same time, the tiny ABC icon of the\\nindicator name field shows us that\\nthis is a text value.\\nAnd in fact, when I click on it, I can see that\\nthis is a string but different to what we have\\nfor the country name field.\\nThe geographic role of indicator name is none.\\nThat's because this is purely a text value.\\nWhat about the year measures we have below?\\nWell, these are numerical values, right?\\nTherefore, it comes as no surprise that when we\\nclick on their icon,\\ndesignating numerical values, we will see these\\nare numbers.\\nOK?

Perfect.\\nEverything's good.\\nOur first visualization and Tableau is almost\\nready.\\nOne last finishing touch I would like to add is\\nto enlarge the bubbles a bit indicating how\\nlarge a country's GDP is to\\ndo that.\\nI can work with the newly appeared sum 2016 pan\\non the right side of the screen, I'll click on\\nits tiny arrow and we'll select\\nedit sizes, the edit sizes, dialog box allows\\nme to enlarge the bubbles we see in\\nthe visualization.\\nI think this will do let's click apply.\\nAnd as you see the bubbles in the visualization\\nincreased.\\nThis makes it a bit easier to compare the GDP\\nof different countries.\\nThe final touch will be to edit the name of\\nthis visualization.\\nI'll double click here and simply type a title.\\nAnything is better than sheet one.\\nThat's why I'll simply type GDP per country\\ncomparison.\\nAnd here we are, that's our first visualization\\nin Tableau and we are just getting\\nstarted\"),\n",

       "[\"Hi, everyone. I'm Ned, and I'll be your instructor for this course.  Tableau is an invaluable tool that's essential to learn on your journey to becoming a successful business intelligence analyst or data scientist.\\n\\nThe art of these professions lies in storytelling—using data to craft compelling narratives and convince top management of the best course of action.\\n\\nBy completing this part of the program, you will learn how to create charts and dashboards in Tableau. This is a crucial step on your path to a data scientist role.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Tableau has grown to become one of the most popular business intelligence tools worldwide. It is a BI software that allows non-technical users to visualize and work with their data almost immediately, dramatically lowering the knowledge barriers present in the past.  Previously, business analysts needed the help of IT personnel to gather and preprocess raw data before visualization could begin.\\n\\nThe advent of Tableau democratized this process, allowing BI analysts—even independent, non-technical individuals—to easily load data and begin exploring it. Tableau's strength lies in its meaningful, intuitive visualizations. This is incredibly valuable; analysts can explore their data immediately without getting bogged down in numbers that offer limited insights, instead focusing on the data that truly matters.  This is why Tableau is an indispensable tool for most corporate business intelligence analysts, data analysts, and data scientists.\\n\\nMany are uncertain about the difference between Tableau and spreadsheet tools like Excel. This is a reasonable doubt, but they serve different purposes. Using Tableau doesn't replace Excel, and vice versa. While Excel is not as powerful or intuitive as Tableau when it comes to data visualization, Tableau is not optimal as a data creation tool. Although it has several database management functionalities, it's not the best solution for performing multiple data operations before analysis.  Furthermore, Tableau isn't ideal for multi-layered calculations.  It can calculate within its own fields, but it shouldn't be used as a spreadsheet tool for complex calculations like budget preparation, where Excel excels.\\n\\nWhere Tableau surpasses the competition is in data visualization. It's a powerful program that visualizes data far more effectively than Excel. For example, Excel cannot interpret spreadsheet cells as geographical locations, while Tableau can, allowing visualization of geographical data distribution.  Moreover, Tableau allows combining various chart types to create meaningful, interactive dashboards that facilitate further analysis.  Once data is visualized, users can easily delve deeper, exploring granular details, identifying unusual spikes, and investigating trends.\\n\\nEven novice Tableau users save significant time by transferring pre-designed Excel dashboards. Uploading new data and updating visuals is much faster in Tableau.  Therefore, a competent analyst needs both Excel and Tableau, as they serve different purposes. Tableau excels in visuals and dashboards, while Excel remains essential for multi-layered calculations.  Just as a combat soldier carries both a rifle and a pistol, using each in different circumstances, a business analyst should be proficient in both Excel and Tableau, applying each as needed.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Okay, guys, it\\'s time to get started with Tableau. Let\\'s type \"Tableau Public\" into Google.  As you can see, the first result points to Tableau\\'s website at www.tableau.com. I\\'ll click on the link, and this will direct me to the Tableau Public domain.\\n\\nIt shouldn\\'t be too difficult to download Tableau from here. If you\\'re wondering why we searched for \"Tableau Public,\" the reason is quite simple: this is Tableau\\'s free version. If you don\\'t have a paid subscription, this is an excellent alternative. You can practice with most of the program\\'s functionalities without paying Tableau\\'s annual fee.\\n\\nSo, it\\'s up to you. You can either use Tableau Public for free or pay for Tableau\\'s desktop version. Both options will allow you to follow along.  There are some limitations, however.  If you want to integrate Tableau Public with programming languages like R, Python, and SQL, you\\'ll need Tableau Desktop. But for now, Tableau Public will be perfectly adequate for practice.\\n\\nAll I have to do here is provide an email address. Once I\\'ve done that, an .exe file will download automatically to my computer. Let\\'s open the .exe file. This is a standard installation procedure; you\\'ll find it similar when installing most programs. I have to agree to Tableau\\'s terms and conditions and then click \"Install.\"\\n\\nOnce the installation starts, I simply have to wait. And there we are—Tableau is installed on my PC. We\\'re ready to start our journey!\\n',\n",
       " 'Right. Great. Here is our freshly installed version of Tableau. I am sure you are anxious to create some fascinating visualizations. So let\\'s get started.\\n\\nFirst, we need to learn how to connect Tableau to the data source we will be working with. There are two options: we can either create a connection to a file or a server.  Of course, we\\'ll choose one of the two depending on where the data is located. Let\\'s connect Tableau to a Microsoft Excel file, as an example.\\n\\nEvery time we use a source file in one of the lectures, you will be able to find it in the supplemental resources section. Just open your course curriculum and download the available files for that lesson.\\n\\nOkay, great. I\\'ll select the file called \"GDP data\" under connections. I can now see that Tableau opened the file. Our source has three sheets: \"data,\" \"metadata countries,\" and \"metadata indicators.\"\\n\\nWhat we usually have to do is choose the worksheet we\\'ll need and drag it into the upper part of the screen where \"Drag sheets here\" is written. Once we do that, Tableau will activate the selected sheet and provide us with a preview of the data. The first two rows of the sheet are empty, and hence we see all of these null values. Tableau is really smart and can often help us with similar issues.\\n\\nAs you can see here, the program suggests using its data interpreter functionality to clean the data. All right, let\\'s do that. And voilà! The first two rows containing no values have disappeared. That\\'s awesome.\\n\\nIn our next video, we\\'ll open our first Tableau worksheet, and I\\'ll be happy to introduce you to its structure. This will do for now. Thanks for watching.\\n',\n",
       " 'So we\\'ve already connected our file to Tableau. Now, in this lesson, we\\'ll be creating our first sheet. It\\'s really easy to do and resembles how we create a sheet in Excel or pretty much every other spreadsheet software. All I have to do is click here, and a new sheet will be created.\\n\\nThis is what a Tableau sheet looks like. We can have as many of them as we want. I can simply click on this little icon at the bottom, and a new worksheet is added. The other two icons next to it are for creating a new dashboard and a new story. We\\'ll deal with dashboards further in the course, so we won\\'t use these buttons for now.\\n\\nLet\\'s give some structure to what you are seeing here. If this software is new to you, things can be a bit confusing. So it will be best if we spend a few minutes—the remainder of this lesson—talking you through Tableau\\'s interface.\\n\\nFirst off, we have ten different tabs on Tableau\\'s default ribbon: File, Data, Worksheet, Dashboard, Story, Analysis, Map, Format, Window, and Help. Let\\'s quickly go through each of them.\\n\\nAs with most programs, the File tab contains certain functionalities related to opening, closing, and saving files. If you like, you can also exit Tableau from here.  The Data tab, on the other hand, is where you will find functionalities related to the data source you are using. Here, you can add a new data connection, replace an existing one, or simply edit the data source of the worksheet you are working with.\\n\\nNext, we have the Worksheet tab. It can be helpful when we want to create a new worksheet, hide or show charts, titles, captions, summaries, and so on. I\\'m sure you noticed that we already created a new sheet with the little icon at the bottom left corner of the sheet, and we can do the same thing from the Worksheet tab as well. Such repetition is common for most programs; functionalities available in the ribbon can be accessed in other ways, too. In fact, I rarely use the ribbon functionalities, but it\\'s good to have an overview and be aware that they are there.\\n\\nNext, we have the Dashboard and Story tabs. As I said, we\\'ll learn more about dashboards and stories later in the course. The Analysis tab is where you can tweak your visualization in terms of labels, show figures as a percentage of the total, add trend lines, legends, filters, and more. We\\'ll explore many of these options later in the course; for now, remember that here we have some interesting functionalities related to the way we perform our analysis and some of the tools we\\'ll incorporate in it.\\n\\nThe Map tab is helpful when we use Tableau\\'s geographic visualization capabilities. Pretty soon, you will see that this is one of the most powerful and impressive Tableau features.  Of course, Format can help us adjust the way our visualization appears. From here, we can modify its font, font size, axes, backgrounds, labels, size, and so much more. That\\'s another tab containing plenty of useful functionalities we\\'ll explore later.  Window and Help are two of the standard tabs we find in most programs, so I\\'m not going to spend much time on them, also because we are not going to use them throughout the course.\\n\\nHowever, one thing we should mention is that Tableau Public has a nice and open community of users who will be able to help you and whose work you can look at if needed. All users of Tableau Public who save their work make it publicly available. Therefore, this can be a useful place where you can search for a given issue you need help with and see what comes up. So if I click on Community and search for \"geography,\" I\\'ll be able to see the work other users have saved previously.\\n\\nThis is Tableau\\'s ribbon. Below the ribbon, we have several buttons that can be quite helpful. The \"Show Start Page\" button takes us to the screen we saw previously when we connected Tableau and our GDP data Excel file. To get back to the sheet that was created earlier, I\\'ll click here. I\\'m sure you know how to work with undo and redo. So if I were to drag one of the fields here, I can go back and undo this action with Undo.  Most of the typical Windows shortcuts can be used here as well, as you probably know. The shortcut for undo is Control+Z.\\n\\nOn the right, we have other useful buttons such as Save, allowing you to save the progress of your work.  Quite intuitively, \"New Data Source\" opens the connect functionality we saw earlier. The other buttons we have here are New Worksheet, Clear, Sheet Swap Rows and Columns, Sort, and so on. We\\'ll explore many of these throughout the course; for now, it would be best if you simply gained an idea of how various objects are positioned within Tableau\\'s interface.\\n\\nOn the left side of Tableau\\'s screen, we have two panes: Data and Analytics. The Data pane is quite important. It shows us what data we\\'ve loaded, and then Tableau classifies the data into two types: Dimensions and Measures. To put it slightly differently, this is a distinction between categorical and numerical data. The data in the Dimensions field cannot be aggregated; it is qualitative in nature. Quite the opposite, Measures can be aggregated and are quantitative in nature. In the next few lessons, we\\'ll learn how to work with these fields. But for now, it would be nice if I just showed you that we can drag Dimensions and Measures into the work area and use them to create our visualizations there.\\n\\nThe work area is where we\\'ll create our visualizations, dashboards, and stories, and this is one way to create a chart. I\\'m sure you noticed that the Columns and Rows part of the sheet started showing us the variables we\\'ve added to the workspace area. We\\'ll explore this part of the interface in a separate video in a few lessons.\\n\\nWhat else do we have? The \"Show Me\" button on the right, which allows us to adjust the type of visualization we use. It\\'s a very cool feature because Tableau tells us what types of visualizations we can choose from, as not all charts will be available depending on the data we have chosen to work with. Once we decide we would like to switch to a different chart, all we need to do is select the respective type of chart, and Tableau makes the adjustment for us.\\n\\nAnd finally, here in the middle, we have three important sections: Pages, Filters, and Marks. The Pages shelf lets you break a view into a series of pages, so you can better analyze how a specific field affects the rest of the data in a view. We\\'ll use the Filter shelf when working with filters and filtering our data. The Marks shelf, on the other hand, contains functionalities related to coloring, size, labels, and so on.\\n\\nThis lesson was a quick overview of Tableau\\'s interface. I\\'m sure now you have a better idea of what you see in front of you when you open the program. In the lessons to come, we\\'ll continue to explore Tableau\\'s functionalities, and you\\'ll learn a ton about each of the buttons we mentioned here. As of now, this will do. Thanks for watching.\\n',\n",
       " 'All right, excellent. It\\'s time to continue our adventure in Tableau. In this lesson, we\\'ll create our first visualization, and it\\'s going to be awesome. Let\\'s get right into it.\\n\\nAs you can see, the workspace area is empty right now. We\\'ve already loaded the GDP data file, which you can see here.  Let\\'s open the GDP data XL file for a second to ensure you\\'re familiar with its structure.  It has a few blank rows, but Tableau took care of them.  We have a column with country names, a column indicating this is GDP data, and several columns with GDP figures for each country. This is the data sheet we are using. Perfect.\\n\\nLet\\'s go back to Tableau. The way the data is organized is interesting.  Focus on the dimensions and measures part of the screen. Tableau has intelligently organized our data: categorical variables are under *Dimensions* (in blue), while numerical data (like a country\\'s GDP) is under *Measures* (in green).\\n\\nAnother important point: some fields are italicized, others aren\\'t. Tableau generates some fields based on the data.  For example, the *Measure Names* field wasn\\'t in our original data source, but Tableau created it because it\\'s useful. The same is true for *Latitude*, *Longitude*, *Number of Records*, and *Measure Values* (in green under Measures). The fields without italics are from the XL file: *Country Name*, *Indicator Name*, and the years 2002 to 2016 (containing the countries\\' GDP figures). Good.\\n\\nTableau also adds an icon next to each field under Dimensions and Measures. This helps us understand how Tableau interprets the data. The *Country Name* field has a globe icon; Tableau recognizes it as relating to countries and is ready to help visualize this data. Clicking the icon shows it\\'s a string, and its geographic role is \"Country/Region,\" as expected.  The *Indicator Name* field has a small \"ABC\" icon, indicating a text value. Clicking it confirms it\\'s a string, but its geographic role is \"None,\" as it\\'s purely textual.\\n\\nThe year measures are numerical values.  Clicking their icons confirms they are numbers.\\n\\nLet\\'s drag the *Country Name* field into the workspace area. Boom! Tableau created a world map showing the location of each country in our data source.  Notice that the fields under Columns and Rows aren\\'t *Country Name*, but the automatically generated *Longitude* and *Latitude* fields. This might seem strange at first, but it\\'s intuitive. Tableau understands *Country Name* is geographical; it doesn\\'t just create a list of countries.  It reads the country names and creates *Longitude* and *Latitude* fields to map each country geographically, resulting in the map we see.\\n\\nNow, if I drag the year 2016 onto the map, Tableau updates the chart, adding each country\\'s 2016 GDP.  Hovering over the dots shows the data; for example, the US 2016 GDP was over $18 trillion, while Canada\\'s was around $1.5 trillion.\\n\\nOur first Tableau visualization is almost ready. Let\\'s enlarge the bubbles to better represent GDP size.  Click the tiny arrow on the *Sum of 2016* pane (on the right), select \"Edit Sizes,\" and enlarge the bubbles.  Click \"Apply.\"  This makes GDP comparisons easier.\\n\\nFinally, let\\'s edit the visualization\\'s name. Double-click the title (\"Sheet 1\") and type \"GDP per Country Comparison.\"  And there we have it—our first Tableau visualization! We\\'re just getting started.\\n',\n",
       " 'Okay, perfect. In this lesson, we\\'ll continue exploring some of Tableau\\'s main features. In particular, we\\'ll learn how to create a table with data and add some custom fields.\\n\\nThe table we will create will be a simple one, providing a monthly and yearly breakdown of a company\\'s sales. As you can see, our original data source contains a column called \"period.\" This column contains both yearly and monthly data. The first four characters designate the year when a sale was made, and the last two contain information about the month.\\n\\nWhat I\\'d like to do is split this information into two separate custom fields: \"year\" and \"month.\" To do that, go to the Analysis tab and create a calculated field.\\n\\nOnce the dialog box opens, type the name of the field you\\'re creating, which is \"year.\" Then, use the `LEFT` function to take the four leftmost characters of the \"period\" field. This will give us the year when the sale occurred.  The `LEFT` function is familiar to most of you, likely from using it in Excel. It works the same way in Tableau.  We\\'ll explore different types of operations you can use to create custom fields in our next lesson.\\n\\nTableau recognizes that you\\'re writing the `LEFT` function and provides autocomplete suggestions. The `LEFT` function requires two arguments: a string (in this case, the \"period\" field from our source sheet) and the number of characters to extract.  It\\'s important to ensure the \"period\" field\\'s data type is a string; otherwise, Tableau will show an error.  Type \"period,\" and Tableau will recognize and allow you to select the field. The second argument is the number of characters—four in this case. Close the brackets, and your new field is ready. If the \"period\" field wasn\\'t a string, we\\'d have problems because `LEFT` requires strings.  If I change the data type of the \"period\" field, Tableau shows a warning next to the newly generated \"year\" field, and we can\\'t use it. Changing the \"period\" field back to a string resolves the issue. Now, you can easily drag the \"year\" field into the workspace.\\n\\nThe other field I\\'d like to create is \"month.\" To do this, use the `RIGHT` function. Again, go to Analysis and create a calculated field. Name it \"month.\"  Use the `RIGHT` function, following the same procedure as before. The string will be the same \"period\" field, and the number of characters will be two (since the month is represented by the two rightmost characters).\\n\\nNow that we have our \"month\" field, let\\'s add it next to \"year\" in the workspace. You can either drag the field into the workspace and place it next to the \"year\" information or drag the \"month\" field next to the \"year\" field in the rows section; the output is the same.\\n\\nNext, create a new calculated field and name it \"Number of Records.\" In the box below, simply type the number \"1\" and press OK. This field represents a simple count of the rows in our source data.\\n\\nWe\\'ve created a table that groups all 12 months of 2016 and 2017.  Insert the \"Number of Records\" field we just created, and voilà! This table shows the breakdown of the company\\'s total number of sales for each month in 2016 and 2017. Awesome!\\n',\n",
       " 'We already know how to create custom fields. We did this twice in our previous lesson, creating the \"years\" and \"months\" fields.  In this lesson, we\\'ll explore other ways to transform your source data and create custom fields.\\n\\nRemember, we shouldn\\'t overcomplicate things with extensive data manipulation. Tableau\\'s primary purpose is visualization, not data creation or modeling. However, performing certain manipulations after loading data into Tableau can be very useful for specific analyses.\\n\\nThe typical Tableau operators you\\'ll need are: plus (+) for addition, minus (-) for subtraction, asterisk (*) for multiplication, forward slash (/) for division, and caret (^) for exponentiation.  Alongside these, you\\'ll use comparison operators such as equals (=), greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equal to (>=), and not equals (≠).\\n\\nTableau\\'s logical functions are similar to those in Excel: AND, OR, and NOT.  Many functions and symbols used in Excel also work in Tableau\\'s calculated fields.  Some of the most commonly used functions include: SUM for summation, AVG for average, MIN and MAX for finding minimum and maximum values, and ABS for returning the absolute value of a number.\\n\\nWe\\'ve already seen the text functions LEFT and RIGHT, which extract the leftmost and rightmost characters from a string, respectively.  Besides LEFT and RIGHT, we can also use other typical text functions available in Excel, such as MID (to extract characters from the middle of a string), UPPER (to convert text to uppercase), and LOWER (to convert text to lowercase).\\n\\nThis recap covers the operators and functions used to create custom fields in Tableau. For more detailed information, a downloadable file is attached to this lesson.\\n\\nThanks for watching.\\n',\n",
       " 'Right. So, we\\'re ready to return to Tableau and perform a few more operations with the table we created earlier.  It currently shows the number of units sold by the firm in each month of 2016 and 2017. Let\\'s change this measure.  I\\'d like it to show the revenue the company generated during each of these periods. How can we do that?\\n\\nWell, it\\'s quite easy. Our source data includes information about price and the number of units sold. Each row represents a single car sale. Therefore, if we multiply the price field and the number of records field, we\\'ll obtain the revenue. Do you agree? Good. Let\\'s do that.\\n\\nWe already know how to create a calculated field. I\\'ll name it \"Revenue,\" and we\\'ll use Tableau\\'s autocomplete suggestions by multiplying \"Price\" and \"Number of Records.\" As we discussed in the previous lesson, we can use the asterisk (*) operator for multiplication.  You\\'ve probably noticed a useful feature: at the bottom of the screen, Tableau indicates whether the calculation is valid. If I remove a few symbols, Tableau will show an error. This is a helpful guide when creating calculations.\\n\\nSo, this is our \"Revenue\" field. We can easily replace the \"Number of Records\" data in the table with it.  Simply drag the \"Revenue\" field and drop it over the \"Number of Records\" data; Tableau will replace the fields. Perfect.\\n\\nAn important metric in our source data is gross profit. By definition, revenue minus cost of goods sold (COGS) equals gross profit. Currently, we have revenue and gross profit. Let\\'s calculate COGS as the difference between the two. That\\'s easy; we just use the minus operator.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s reorder our table. First, revenue; then COGS; finally, gross profit. We can do this by dragging and dropping the three fields within the table. Note that their values appear in the \"Measure Values\" card on the left. We can change their order from there or directly within the table.  Your choice.\\n\\nOne more thing: you\\'ve probably noticed the \"Measure Names\" field in the Columns section. This is an auto-generated field Tableau uses to structure our table and separate the names of different measures. If we remove it from the Columns section, the table will lose its structure, and all three measures will be combined. Let\\'s press Ctrl+Z to undo that.\\n\\nExcellent. In our next lesson, we\\'ll learn how to add totals and subtotals to our Tableau tables. That\\'s all for now. Thanks for watching.\\n',\n",
       " \"Most executives—and by most, I mean all of them—prefer receiving tables that contain totals and subtotals. This makes it easier for them to digest information quickly.\\n\\nIn this lesson, we will learn how to add totals and subtotals to our Tableau tables.  This is helpful because the table we've been working on in the last few videos doesn't contain totals for 2016 and 2017. We'll add them in this video.  It's fairly easy to do.\\n\\nI'll go to *Analysis*, then *Totals*, and select *Show Column Grand Totals*. The totals we just added are for the entire period of 2016 and 2017.  However, that's not very useful.  When someone is interested in a company's sales or gross profit, they want to know how much it made in a specific year and whether it performed better than the previous year. A company will also want to know how its yearly sales compare to other companies.\\n\\nSo, I'll go to *Analysis* > *Totals* and unclick *Show Column Grand Totals* to remove the total we just added.  Instead, I'll select *Add All Subtotals*. This will give me the total figures for 2016 and 2017 separately.\\n\\nThis is much better. Now we can easily read the table. The fictitious numbers help us compare 2016 and 2017 and give us a good idea of the actual sales for that period.\\n\\nIn our next lesson, we'll add percentage gross margin to our table.\\n\\nThanks for watching.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Okay, excellent. We\\'re doing well. We\\'ve seen several interesting Tableau tools so far, and we\\'ll continue to explore more during this lesson.  Our table is almost ready; we have revenue, cost of goods sold (COGS), and gross profit.\\n\\nNow, I think we should add a gross margin calculation next to the gross profit figures. Gross margin is helpful because it shows the portion of revenue converted into gross profit after accounting for the cost of goods sold.\\n\\nLet\\'s add a new calculated field. I\\'ll name it \"GM percent.\"  We\\'ll divide gross profit by revenue. We already know how to do that.  Here we are; we\\'ve calculated a new field. Let\\'s add it to the table by inserting it into the Measure Values card.\\n\\nI\\'ve added the new field next to gross profit, but it looks strange, doesn\\'t it?  If we divide gross profit by revenue, we\\'d expect a number around 10%, 20%, 30%, or maybe 50%, certainly not 1000%. What\\'s happening when I divide 71 million by 244 million (January\\'s figures)? I get approximately 29%.\\n\\nThere are two possibilities: either Tableau miscalculated the simple division, or our formula is incorrect. It\\'s most likely our formula, not the software.\\n\\nI\\'ll remove the \"GM percent\" field from the Measure Values box and edit the calculated field. We forgot to use the `SUM` function around the two variables. Without `SUM`, we\\'re not dividing the total figures for each month. Let\\'s adjust our calculated field and see what happens.\\n\\nThis column shows numbers that look like zeros, but they\\'re likely percentage values. Let\\'s change how the \"GM percent\" column is displayed. I\\'ll click on the \"GM percent\" variable in the Measure Values card and select the \"Format\" option. We have several options; I\\'ll choose a percentage format with one decimal place.\\n\\nVoilà! Our table is ready. In our next lesson, we\\'ll add a filter to choose between viewing 2016 and 2017 values individually or together. See you then!\\n',\n",
       " 'One of the most interesting options available in Tableau is adding a filter to your visualization. In this lesson, we\\'ll learn how to do just that.  We\\'ll add a filter to our table from a user\\'s perspective.\\n\\nThe only field that makes sense to filter in this table is the \"Year\" field. A person might be interested in seeing numbers for only 2016 or 2017, for example.\\n\\nSo, I\\'ll select the \"Analysis\" tab, then select \"Filters,\" choosing the \"Year\" field.  As we decided, we want to create a filter for years.  A filter will then appear on the right side of the workspace.\\n\\nNow, we can easily hide 2017. For example, I\\'ll simply uncheck its value, and everything related to 2017 disappears from the sheet—pretty cool, right?  Of course, we can do the same with 2016. I\\'ll select 2017 and uncheck 2016.\\n\\nWhen we click the small arrow in the upper-right corner of the filter pane, we find many options to adjust the filter. For example, we can change its appearance to a single-value list (radio buttons), a drop-down menu, a multiple-values list, and so on.\\n\\nWe can easily change the filter\\'s formatting by selecting \"Format Filters,\" or alternatively, change the filter\\'s title by clicking the \"Edit Title\" button.\\n\\nWe can also choose whether to apply the filter to the current worksheet only or to all worksheets in the Tableau file. This is really useful when working with several interrelated sheets.\\n\\nThis was a short introduction to filters in Tableau.  Thanks for watching.\\n',\n",
       " 'One of the most important aspects of your work in Tableau is the data source you are using to perform analysis. Quite often, the data will be stored in multiple locations, and hence you will have to deal with a number of data sources that live in different environments. Nevertheless, you will want to use all of the data available to you and run analysis on everything together.\\n\\nThe way we merge multiple data sources is by using joins. For those of you who have already followed our program and especially our SQL videos, you\\'ll be familiar with what follows in this video. So feel free to skip ahead or continue watching as a refresher.\\n\\nLet\\'s focus on performing cross-data table joins. We want to combine two or more data tables to create a unique database. How do we join separate data tables? Well, there are a few ways to do that: we can create an inner, outer, left, or right join.\\n\\nLet\\'s open an Excel file to better demonstrate what each type of join represents. Here, we have two very simple tables. The first shows the age of three basketball players, and the second shows the salary of basketball players. Please note that the two tables are different due to their last rows. We have LeBron James in the first table and Kyrie Irving in the second.\\n\\nOkay, let\\'s say we would like to run some analysis and use the data available in both tables. Therefore, as described earlier, we have to use joins. But how do we do that? We can easily see that the two tables have one column in common: the \"Basketball Player\" column. This column will serve as a key.\\n\\nWhen we put together the information from both tables, a left join means that the left column of the first table will lead the way. We will use it to create a table containing age and salary information about the three players we see here. Whenever we find one of these players in the right table, we\\'ll add their salary to the new table. As you can see, if their name is not present in the right table (which is the case with LeBron James\\' salary), we will have a null value in the table. If a player\\'s name is not present in the left column of the first table, we will not include any information about them, as this is a left join, and any rows not present in the key field of the left table are omitted in the new table.\\n\\nA right join functions in the same way. However, this time, the left column of the second table leads the way. Kyrie Irving replaces LeBron James, who is not present in the left table. Hence, the only missing value would be Kyrie Irving\\'s age, given that the only information we have about him is in the right table.\\n\\nThe case when we are interested in the intersection of the two tables only is called an inner join. This is when we create a table that contains rows where we have an exact match between the key fields we are joining the two tables with—in our case, \"Basketball Player.\" This time, the newly created table contains only two rows, as both tables contain information about these players. Hence, this is an inner join.\\n\\nAn outer join would be the opposite case: we add all rows of the two tables, regardless of whether there is a match in the key field we are linking with. When there isn\\'t a match, we would have null values, which is the case with both LeBron James and Kyrie Irving.\\n\\nThese are the main principles you need to understand when deciding whether to create a left, right, inner, or outer join in Tableau, depending on your needs and the specific case you are working on. You will then be able to apply one of these structures and join your data.\\n',\n",
       " \"Hello and welcome back. Now that we're nearly finished with our introduction to Tableau, it's time to start creating great-looking charts and use them to build a complete dashboard. This is way more exciting than getting acquainted with Tableau's interface, isn't it?\\n\\nWe'll solve a complete real-life exercise, and each lesson will build upon the previous one. Sounds great, right? All right, then let's get started. Here's the Excel data we'll use. It was provided by a company that has produced several audiobooks and has been selling them at an online marketplace. One of the main components of that marketplace is reviews. So we have two files: one about sales and another containing information about reviews customers left for each audiobook. Both files contain the date when a purchase or a review occurred.\\n\\nIt would be great if we manage to produce a table that takes advantage of both types of data—when a person bought an audiobook and when and with which rating a person left a review. If we manage to do that, we'll be able to create several different charts in Tableau that would allow us to learn if the number of reviews the company receives has been growing; how the average review score changed over time; what the percentage breakdown is between 10-star, 9-star, 8-star, and other types of reviews; what percentage of people acquiring an audiobook leave a review; and visualize the correlation between audiobook sales and the number of reviews, or perhaps visualize the correlation between average review score and sales.\\n\\nIn the lessons to come, you'll see how to do all of that. Stay tuned, and thanks for watching.\\n\",\n",
       " \"All right, very good. Let's take a look at the following picture. This is our target outcome for this exercise.  Our goal is to create a dashboard containing three charts.\\n\\nThe first chart will show the number of reviews, with a second axis displaying the monthly average score.  The second chart will be a pie chart showing the percentage of reviews each audiobook received. For example, 50% for audiobook 1, 25% for audiobook 2, 10% for audiobook 3, and so on. Finally, the third chart will display the ratio between reviews left and the number of audiobook purchases. This visualization will help us understand the percentage of people who buy an audiobook, listen to it, and then leave a review.\\n\\nThese three charts will form the foundation of the dashboard we'll create later. I've added a note indicating that once the dashboard is complete, we'll be able to view aggregate data or use filters to analyze the performance of individual audiobooks. Sounds exciting, right?\\n\\nAs a side note, it's generally good practice to design your Tableau dashboards before you begin building them. This allows you to pre-plan your desired outcome and verify its feasibility.  More importantly, it encourages you to consider which visualizations best serve your business needs.\\n\\nOK, great. Let's get started in our next lesson.\\n\",\n",
       " 'As usual, the first thing we need to do when starting a new project is load our data. Our two source files are audiobook reviews and audiobook sales. Let\\'s connect them to Tableau.  Here are the audiobook reviews and audiobook sales files, located in the same folder. We\\'ll need both.\\n\\nTo combine the information from both tables, we\\'ll need to join them.  First, double-click the audiobook sales gray button. Then, drag the audiobook reviews table from the sheets field on the left. We\\'ve just created the join.  Our goal is a unique table containing information about all transactions for all audiobooks and their respective reviews. The transaction ID column is the perfect link between the two files, as it\\'s available in both and can serve as a common field.\\n\\nOne of the main aspects we\\'ll explore in this lesson is how to create a connection between two tables in Tableau.  Remember that we\\'ll distinguish between \"data connection\" and \"table connection.\" A table connection, performed by joining or blending, combines data from two or more data sources. A data connection, on the other hand, represents a single data source connection between Tableau and a data source (like an Excel workbook or SQL database).\\n\\nWhen we imported the second file, Tableau created a connection between the two. The symbol indicates we\\'ve created an inner join. Technically, when creating a join, Tableau sends a query to the database; the join is implemented at the database level, and the output is brought back to Tableau for analysis. An inner join combines tables with a common field.\\n\\nTableau initially created an inner join using the \"audiobook name\" parameter, but we need to link the tables using the \"transaction ID\" parameter, as our analysis focuses on user sales and reviews.  Clicking the inner join symbol opens the join menu. Let\\'s substitute the field.  I\\'ll select \"transaction ID\" to create the connection.\\n\\nHere\\'s a preview of the table created through an inner join using transaction ID as the primary key. An inner join considers only the intersection—where the primary key is found in both tables. For example, if a person with a given transaction ID purchased a course but didn\\'t leave a review, they won\\'t be included.  An inner join requires users to have both purchased a course and left a rating, with both purchase and rating dates known.  It only contains rows with a transaction ID, purchase date, review date, review rating, and audiobook information.  Cases where a person bought an audiobook but didn\\'t rate it are excluded.\\n\\nDo you think this information is important? Do we want to understand how reviews impacted sales and whether we can see a pattern in total purchases with respect to reviews?  Of course!  But an inner join won\\'t provide this information.  Therefore, we need a different type of join—one that includes information about purchases even if no review was left.\\n\\nLooking at the diagram, I\\'ll select a left join, given that the audiobook sales file is on the left. We want a table containing information about *all* audiobook purchases, including cases where buyers didn\\'t provide a rating. A left join is more suitable than an inner join in this case.\\n\\nIn our next lesson, we\\'ll check the data\\'s accuracy in Tableau.  This will do for now.\\n',\n",
       " 'Right. Our pace is excellent. In this lesson, we\\'ll verify that the data loaded through our join accurately reflects the figures in the two source files. Let\\'s open Sheet 1 and perform a few checks.\\n\\nFirst, let\\'s determine the total number of sales transactions. We\\'ll drag the \"Number of Records\" field into the workspace. Tableau quickly shows us 110,570 rows with transaction ID information—representing all audiobook sales during the analysis period.  A quick check of the sales Excel file confirms this number.\\n\\nNext, let\\'s change the format of the \"Date of Purchase\" field to \"Date.\" I prefer it among the dimensions fields, with a calendar icon indicating its date type.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s check the number of ratings from the reviews file.  Dragging the \"Ratings\" field into the workspace initially yields 96,897, which is too high. This is because we\\'re summing, not counting, the ratings.  Correcting this to count the ratings gives us 10,798. Let\\'s verify this number as well.  Yes, that\\'s correct.\\n\\nOne final check: Let\\'s add the \"Date of Purchase\" field to the columns and increase the data granularity to a monthly breakdown. This is a simple yet powerful Tableau feature.\\n\\nGranularity refers to the level of detail in a data field. In our example, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly breakdowns represent different levels of granularity for the \"Date of Purchase\" field.\\n\\nHere\\'s the monthly breakdown of reviews. Wait, something\\'s strange. According to Tableau, we received no reviews in December 2017, but I know we did.  Our Excel file proves it.\\n\\nWhat happened? Tableau can be easily confused when joining data and using dimensions like \"Purchase Date\" from the sales file and \"Rating\" from the reviews file.  The date fields from the two joined tables don\\'t seem to match correctly.\\n\\nWhenever you encounter such issues, it\\'s best to use data blending as an alternative to Tableau joins. We\\'ll cover this in our next lesson.\\n\\nThanks for watching.\\n',\n",
       " 'Data blending is a method of combining data that supplements a table of data from one data source with columns of data from another data source. In our case, we would combine the sales data from the audiobook sales file with the ratings column from the audiobook reviews file.\\n\\nHow does blending differ from joining? You can think of a data blend as a specific type of left join that is preferable or necessary, depending on various conditions. Sometimes, using a join will do a perfect job, while in other situations, blending will either deliver better or quicker results or be the only solution.  Moreover, joining data is something you do manually, whereas data blending is a functionality that Tableau implements automatically while you are working on your sheet. This makes it a more intuitive feature to use, provided that the following conditions are met: both data tables are separate data sources, and there is a field that serves as the connection between them, allowing us to carry out queries that leverage information from both tables. So, one of the preliminary basic requirements to blend data in Tableau is to have a common field creating the connection between the two data tables.\\n\\nFrom a technical perspective, what blending does is take separate query results from each data source and aggregate them in the Tableau view. Only then will it connect and join the query results on the same common field, which should contain information of the same data type. This is different from the case when you are using a join, where the aggregation is happening at the database level, and just the output of the join is being brought back to Tableau. When blending, the aggregation occurs in Tableau.\\n\\nSo what are the benefits of blending data? It turns out that joining or blending can bring different results.  And here is the tricky part: if you join two data tables containing duplicate values that are not aggregated properly during preliminary data work, you will obtain an artificially inflated data set.  Blending solves that problem automatically; Tableau will consider the level of granularity you have chosen in the view (in other words, in your sheet) and will combine the data sources with aggregated fields directly.\\n\\nI think we are ready to create an actual blend in Tableau. Let\\'s open the audiobook sales file first. Then, once I\\'ve opened the file, I\\'ll open a sheet and click on \"New Data Source\" from the Data tab. This is how we will create a new data connection and load both files at the same time without creating a join.\\n\\nAs we can see here, both files are open in Tableau. To make sure we\\'ve created a blend, I can open the \"Edit Relationships\" dialog box and see whether Tableau has created a connection between the two files. In our case, things are pretty straightforward because Tableau immediately recognized that the two files contain columns with the same name, \"Transaction ID.\" The primary data source is the audiobook sales file, which is excellent. This means it would represent the left table of the left join performed while blending the data in Tableau. Alternatively, the view will use all rows from the audiobook sales; the audiobook review instead acts as a secondary data source, the right table. Therefore, while blending, Tableau will use the aggregated rows from this data source based on the dimension of the common fields.\\n\\nFor the sake of exercise, let\\'s select the \"Custom Relationship\" radio button and choose not one but two different fields that serve as the connection between the two files. This is similar to having a two-column primary key and a two-column foreign key in SQL. I\\'ll click on \"Add\" and then would like to connect the \"Date of Review\" and the \"Date of Purchase.\" Hmm, I can\\'t see the \"Date of Purchase\" in here. What is the reason? Well, Tableau didn\\'t recognize that this is a dimension and added this field among measures. Let\\'s change its data type and open the \"Edit Relationships\" window and select to add a new custom relationship which connects the two files based on the \"Date of Purchase\" and \"Date of Review.\" And that\\'s how we edit the relationship Tableau created.\\n\\nLet\\'s switch back to the automatic connection Tableau created. In our next video, we\\'ll test whether blending solved the problem we experienced earlier. Hopefully, we will be able to combine sales and reviews without any problems. Stay tuned.\\n',\n",
       " 'Now that we have created a blend, we can go ahead and make a quick check. This will allow us to see if the numbers we will be working with look fine. Let\\'s start with the number of sales transactions. First, I\\'ll simply drag the \"Measure Values\" field into the workspace area.  110,570. Precisely what we expected. Good. The number of sales transactions is as expected.\\n\\nNext, I\\'ll remove this field and open the audiobook reviews data to check the number of ratings. I\\'ll simply drag and drop the \"Rating\" field. But this time, Tableau displays an error. It tells us that fields cannot be used from the audiobook reviews data source because there is no relationship to the primary data source. We find out our data is not yet blended. To do that, we have to click on the tiny link icon next to \"Transaction ID\" and choose this to be our linking field. The error we observed previously will no longer appear because our two data sources are now properly linked. Great! This is a field that shouldn\\'t be summed but counted, as we are interested in the number of ratings left by students, not the total sum of their ratings. 10,798. Again, the number we expected. It\\'s time for the true test. These numbers were okay last time, too. Remember? Let\\'s plot the number of reviews and the \"Date of Purchase\" field from the audiobook sales file. All I have to do is add \"Date of Purchase\" to the Columns shelf and then choose a monthly breakdown instead of an annual breakdown.\\n\\nOh, no, December 2017 is empty again. What can we do now? Blending doesn\\'t work either. Let\\'s have some faith; we\\'ll figure it out. I\\'ll go to Data and open the \"Edit Relationships\" menu. Here, we can choose the primary data source, which should be \"Audiobook Sales,\" and the fields that serve as a link between the two files. Let\\'s opt for a custom selection and add the following fields: First, I\\'ll link the \"Year of Review Date\" with the \"Year of Purchase Date,\" and the \"Month of Review Date\" with the \"Month of Purchase Date.\" Once we are ready, we can click \"OK\" and see if the situation has changed. Checking the count of the number of reviews with respect to the purchase date will show us whether we\\'ve managed to solve the problem by using different linking fields, and it appears that we have. Here\\'s a timeline that shows the number of ratings left each month. We have 653 reviews for December, not zero. And that\\'s excellent! Wow.\\n\\nIt took us a while, but we figured it out. We had to edit relationships and adjust the field that serves as a link between the two files. Otherwise, we would have been left with a wrong graph, which would be unacceptable in a professional environment, as wrong visualizations lead to wrong business insights. In our next lesson, we\\'ll create the first chart for our dashboard. Thanks for watching.\\n',\n",
       " 'Okay, excellent. We are ready to start with the first chart that will be inserted into our dashboard. Therefore, I\\'ll rename the worksheet to \"Chart 1.\"\\n\\nLet\\'s add the \"Date of Review\" information to the Columns shelf. This is where we\\'ll be able to see the timing of purchases and reviews. As usual, we are interested in a breakdown by month. So I\\'ll select \"Month.\" The workspace area shows us that review dates range from February 2017 to February 2018, which is what we expected.\\n\\nLet\\'s insert some data. I\\'ll add the number of ratings using the COUNT function. Everything\\'s fine, and we have data for December 2017, so we can forget about that problem.\\n\\nAccording to our initial plan, this will be a chart showing the number of reviews and the average review score per month, displayed on a secondary axis. So I\\'ll add the \"Rating\" field to the Rows shelf a second time. But this time, we want the average of these numbers, and we\\'d like to create a dual axis. Excellent.\\n\\nObviously, we will have to fine-tune the axis scale.  Right now, the chart doesn\\'t show a good match. I\\'ll simply double-click and choose a fixed range starting from eight and going all the way up to 10, which is the maximum review score we can have.\\n\\nHowever, right now, the two charts overlap strangely, and we are unable to see their trends clearly. So I\\'ll increase the size of the axis to 12 and change the color of both variables: \"Number of Ratings\" and \"Average Ratings.\" That\\'s easy to do. I need to select one of the two variables and then click on the \"Color\" button under \"Marks.\" Once we\\'ve opened the \"Edit Colors\" menu, we can choose colors we like better. I like yellow and blue. Awesome.\\n\\nI\\'m not a fan of opacity, which adds a transparency effect and sort of mixes the colors in our chart. Therefore, I\\'ll opt for 100% opacity for both variables. See, the chart looks nicer.\\n\\nLet\\'s edit its axes again. That\\'s easy. We have to double-click on a specific axis and type the axis title we want. I\\'ll change \"Counter Rating\" to \"Number of Ratings,\" and \"Month of Review Date\" to \"Month.\" I believe \"Average Rating\" doesn\\'t need to be changed.\\n\\nVery good. This is our first chart. Does it give us any meaningful information? Well, yes, I believe it does. First, we can see that the number of reviews left by people has been increasing, which is great. The average review score is almost nine and sometimes even higher, which is a pretty high score but should be interpreted in comparison with the rest of the market. Moreover, we don\\'t see a dependence between the number of reviews and average ratings, which means that average review scores are not influenced by the number of people leaving reviews. All of this is quite interesting.\\n\\nLet\\'s continue this work in our next lesson when we will create the second chart for our dashboard. Thanks for watching.\\n',\n",
       " 'Hi, and welcome back to this video. We\\'ll create the second chart, which will be part of our dashboard: a pie chart showing the percentage of total reviews that each audiobook obtained.  The number of reviews is quite important in the marketplace we are studying; this is why we\\'re interested in finding out which audiobooks collected the most reviews. An alternative visualization would be a pie chart showing the percentage of people who purchased a given audiobook. Okay.\\n\\nGiven that we know what we\\'d like to accomplish, things should be easier, right? I\\'ll add the rating field to the workspace area. The number we obtain is the sum of all ratings. Let\\'s use \"count\" for this measure. Perfect. The total number of reviews is 10,798. And we know for a fact that that is true.\\n\\nLet\\'s go ahead and add the audiobook names dimension above the rating field. This creates a breakdown by audiobook—exactly what we want. Now, I can simply select the pie chart icon within the \"Show Me\" functionality, and I\\'ll create a pie chart. It\\'s a really tiny one, but still a pie chart! To increase the chart\\'s size, I can simply click anywhere in the workspace area, hold the Control key, and then use the arrow keys. If I press Control and the up arrow, the chart grows vertically; Control and the right arrow increases the chart\\'s size horizontally. The opposite is also true. We can decrease the chart\\'s size by pressing Control and the down arrow or Control and the left arrow. Awesome.\\n\\nWhat else do we need? Labels, right? Otherwise, it\\'s difficult to gain an idea of what portion of overall reviews a specific audiobook accounted for. I\\'ll drag the rating field into the label, and the number of reviews appears next to each audiobook. Again, we need the count of ratings, and not the sum. Okay. But how do we display these as a percentage? That\\'s not that difficult. Actually, all I have to do is go to Analysis, select \"Percentage Of,\" and then click on \"Table.\" Boom! Here we are.\\n\\nThese are the percentages each audiobook accounted for among the total number of reviews. The pie chart and the labels we added show us that Audiobooks 1 and 2 accounted for more than 50% of the total number of reviews the company received. Very interesting. The business relies greatly on these bestsellers.\\n\\nIn our next lesson, we\\'ll create the third and final chart that will allow us to complete our initial plan and obtain the dashboard we intended from the very beginning.\\n',\n",
       " 'Okay, we\\'re almost ready for chart number three. I hope you are too.  Here we go!\\n\\nIn this lesson, we\\'ll create a chart showing the ratio between customer reviews and the number of audiobook purchases in a given month. This is an important KPI, showing us whether people who buy audiobooks are leaving reviews. To do this, we\\'ll need to create a few calculated fields.\\n\\nFirst, let\\'s create a field that counts the number of ratings—not the sum, but the count.  It\\'ll be easier to use this field going forward. We\\'ll name this field \"Number of Ratings,\" and we\\'ll simply use the COUNT function.\\n\\nNext, we\\'ll create a calculated field called \"Number of Purchases.\" Let\\'s change the data source to \"Audiobook Sales.\" This field will contain the number of audiobook sales the company made.  How do we count purchases? Well, the transaction ID is unique, so counting those will give us the number of sales transactions—exactly what we need.\\n\\nGood. Now we can create the final calculated field: the ratio between reviews and new purchases. This is easy since we\\'ve already created the \"Number of Ratings\" and \"Number of Purchases\" fields. We just divide the two, and we\\'ll have the measure we want to plot.\\n\\nLet\\'s add this ratio to the rows of our visualization. The result is a nice bar chart (though a bit large), which is quite meaningful.  It shows that the ratio of ratings to new purchases was significantly lower in November 2017 and much higher the month before—three times higher, to be precise. I\\'m sure the firm\\'s business intelligence team would want to investigate the reason for this discrepancy.\\n\\nLet\\'s quickly edit the horizontal axis title to \"Month\" and save our work. In our next lesson, we\\'ll organize these charts into a dashboard. Stay tuned, and thanks for watching!\\n',\n",
       " 'Congratulations on making it this far in our Tableau training! Let\\'s take a moment to review what we\\'ve covered. We began by exploring how Tableau aids corporate decision-making and learned to install Tableau Public.  We then connected data to Tableau, familiarized ourselves with the interface, and created our first Tableau chart.  We also learned to duplicate sheets, create tables, and build custom fields to easily manipulate data.  Furthermore, we added totals and subtotals to tables, worked with filters, and explored functionalities for working with multiple data sources, such as joins and data blending.  Most recently, we created three meaningful charts.\\n\\nNow, we\\'ll build our dashboard—the final piece of the puzzle. It will be insightful to see these three charts together and analyze them simultaneously.  Let\\'s create a new dashboard. I\\'ll click on the tiny icon that displays \"New Dashboard\" when hovered over.\\n\\nOnce the dashboard is created, I\\'ll adjust its size. It\\'s currently too small. I\\'ll modify the settings on the left to make it 1000 pixels wide and 800 pixels high. I hope you\\'re viewing this on a large screen!\\n\\nNow, let\\'s drag and drop the three charts. Tableau intelligently manages space and anticipates our actions as we position the cursor.  However, some adjustments are needed. I\\'ll remove the legends; we only need the audiobook legend, and I\\'ll place it below the pie chart for clarity.  I\\'ll simply drag the legend to its new position.  Let\\'s resize it slightly to remove any overlapping arrows.\\n\\nTo remove the pie chart\\'s arrows and ensure a proper fit, we\\'ll adjust its size.  I\\'ll slightly reduce the pie chart\\'s size horizontally and vertically in the chart editor, then return to the dashboard to see the result.  Great, the arrows are gone!\\n\\nNext, let\\'s improve the chart titles; they\\'re currently not very descriptive.  A better title for the first chart would be \"Number of Reviews and Average Rating.\" I\\'ll set the font size to 11 and bold the text.  We\\'ll do the same for the other charts for consistency.  The pie chart\\'s title will be \"Number of Reviews by Audiobook,\" and the third chart\\'s title will be \"Ratio of Reviews to Sales.\"\\n\\nOur dashboard is nearly complete. In the next lesson, I\\'ll show you how to add a filter, transforming this into a truly interactive tool that allows for deeper analysis and simultaneous filtering of all three charts.\\n',\n",
       " 'Okay, guys, we\\'re almost there!  Our goal in this lesson is to add a filter to our data, allowing us to select specific audiobooks for analysis directly from the dashboard. Sounds useful, right?\\n\\nThe data we see is meaningful and shows important trends. However, actionable decisions will likely need to be made at the individual audiobook level, addressing the specific performance of each audiobook our firm sells.\\n\\nAll right, let\\'s add a filter to chart number two, the pie chart. I\\'ll click the small arrow in its upper right corner (containing more options) and apply \"Audiobook Name\" as a filter. We\\'ll need to adjust the charts\\' size and position on the dashboard slightly to improve the arrow\\'s visibility. I think this will do.\\n\\nNow, when I use the filter, changes only affect the pie chart; the other two charts remain unchanged because the filter doesn\\'t currently affect them.  We want this filter to modify the entire dashboard, not just one chart. How do we do that?\\n\\nLet\\'s select the small arrow in the filter\\'s upper right corner and choose \"Apply to Worksheets.\" In the dialog box, we can select chart one and chart three, then press \"OK.\"\\n\\nHopefully, the filter now affects all three charts.  And yes, it does!  However, something seems odd. When I unfilter the first few audiobooks, the ratio of reviews to sales continues to decrease—which doesn\\'t make sense.  It appears the ratios are calculated relative to the total number of audiobooks. That\\'s strange. Let\\'s check.\\n\\nI suspect a problem with the other two charts.  Looking closer, I see the blending connection for the \"Audiobook Name\" field hasn\\'t been activated. Let\\'s activate the connection for both charts and see if that changes things.\\n\\nNow, when I unfilter the first few audiobooks, the percentage doesn\\'t decrease; it even goes up. I believe this is correct.\\n\\nRemember: To use chart elements as filters, simply select \"Use as Filter\" in the upper right corner of a chart.  All three charts will then update. This is another way to use filters—filtering directly from the filter or clicking a chart element makes little difference; a filter will be applied in either case.\\n\\nWe\\'ve created a dashboard that can be easily filtered and unfiltered. Now we can explore the relationship between different audiobooks, their number of reviews, average score, and the ratio of reviews to sales. That\\'s awesome! Play around with the data and share your insights. Great job completing this exercise!\\n\\nIt was a pleasure teaching you Tableau, and we hope to see you in our other modules. Until then, a warm hug and thanks for watching!\\n',\n",
       " 'Hi, many of you have experienced difficulties with this part of the exercise: creating filters.  This video aims to clarify any doubts you may have before applying the filter to all three charts.\\n\\nFirst, ensure your blending connections are working correctly. Go to Chart 1 and click on \"Data,\" then \"Edit Relationships.\"  Make sure a relationship exists for \"Audiobook Names.\"  Repeat this check for all three charts.  If the blending connections are active, they should be colored red. To check, click on the \"Audiobook Sales\" data source and click the icon next to \"Audiobook Names.\"\\n\\nOnce the connections are active, you can add the filter. Select the pie chart (Chart 2) and click the small arrow in the upper right corner. Then, select \"Filter Audiobook Name.\"\\n\\nTo apply this filter to the entire dashboard, go to the upper right corner of the dashboard (where the \"Audiobook Names\" filter is located), select the small arrow again, and click \"Apply to Worksheets.\" Then, select \"Selected Worksheets\" and check all three charts.\\n\\nOkay. The filter should now be working correctly. Please check your own workbook to verify this.\\n\\nThanks for watching.\\n']"

Tableau is an invaluable tool that's essential to learn on your journey to becoming a successful business intelligence analyst or data scientist.\\n\\nThe art of these professions lies in storytelling—using data to craft compelling narratives and convince top management of the best course of action.\\n\\nBy completing this part of the program, you will learn how to create charts and dashboards in Tableau. This is a crucial step on your path to a data scientist role.\\n\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'Section Title': 'Introduction to Tableau', 'Course Title': 'Why use Tableau: Make your data make an impact'}, page_content=\"Tableau has grown to become one of the most popular business intelligence tools worldwide. It is a BI software that allows non-technical users to visualize and work with their data almost immediately, dramatically lowering the knowledge barriers present in the past.  Previously, business analysts needed the help of IT personnel to gather and preprocess raw data before visualization could begin.\\n\\nThe advent of Tableau democratized this process, allowing BI analysts—even independent, non-technical individuals—to easily load data and begin exploring it. Tableau's strength lies in its meaningful, intuitive visualizations. This is incredibly valuable; analysts can explore their data immediately without getting bogged down in numbers that offer limited insights, instead focusing on the data that truly matters.  This is why Tableau is an indispensable tool for most corporate business intelligence analysts, data analysts, and data scientists.\\n\\nMany are uncertain about the difference between Tableau and spreadsheet tools like Excel. This is a reasonable doubt, but they serve different purposes. Using Tableau doesn't replace Excel, and vice versa. While Excel is not as powerful or intuitive as Tableau when it comes to data visualization, Tableau is not optimal as a data creation tool. Although it has several database management functionalities, it's not the best solution for performing multiple data operations before analysis.  Furthermore, Tableau isn't ideal for multi-layered calculations.  It can calculate within its own fields, but it shouldn't be used as a spreadsheet tool for complex calculations like budget preparation, where Excel excels.\\n\\nWhere Tableau surpasses the competition is in data visualization. It's a powerful program that visualizes data far more effectively than Excel. For example, Excel cannot interpret spreadsheet cells as geographical locations, while Tableau can, allowing visualization of geographical data distribution.  Moreover, Tableau allows combining various chart types to create meaningful, interactive dashboards that facilitate further analysis.  Once data is visualized, users can easily delve deeper, exploring granular details, identifying unusual spikes, and investigating trends.\\n\\nEven novice Tableau users save significant time by transferring pre-designed Excel dashboards. Uploading new data and updating visuals is much faster in Tableau.  Therefore, a competent analyst needs both Excel and Tableau, as they serve different purposes. Tableau excels in visuals and dashboards, while Excel remains essential for multi-layered calculations.  Just as a combat soldier carries both a rifle and a pistol, using each in different circumstances, a business analyst should be proficient in both Excel and Tableau, applying each as needed.\\n\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'Section Title': 'Introduction to Tableau', 'Course Title': \"Let's download Tableau Public\"}, page_content='Okay, guys, it\\'s time to get started with Tableau. Let\\'s type \"Tableau Public\" into Google.  As you can see, the first result points to Tableau\\'s website at www.tableau.com. I\\'ll click on the link, and this will direct me to the Tableau Public domain.\\n\\nIt shouldn\\'t be too difficult to download Tableau from here. If you\\'re wondering why we searched for \"Tableau Public,\" the reason is quite simple: this is Tableau\\'s free version. If you don\\'t have a paid subscription, this is an excellent alternative. You can practice with most of the program\\'s functionalities without paying Tableau\\'s annual fee.\\n\\nSo, it\\'s up to you. You can either use Tableau Public for free or pay for Tableau\\'s desktop version. Both options will allow you to follow along.  There are some limitations, however.  If you want to integrate Tableau Public with programming languages like R, Python, and SQL, you\\'ll need Tableau Desktop. But for now, Tableau Public will be perfectly adequate for practice.\\n\\nAll I have to do here is provide an email address. Once I\\'ve done that, an .exe file will download automatically to my computer. Let\\'s open the .exe file. This is a standard installation procedure; you\\'ll find it similar when installing most programs. I have to agree to Tableau\\'s terms and conditions and then click \"Install.\"\\n\\nOnce the installation starts, I simply have to wait. And there we are—Tableau is installed on my PC. We\\'re ready to start our journey!\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'Section Title': 'Introduction to Tableau', 'Course Title': 'Connecting data in Tableau'}, page_content='Right. Great. Here is our freshly installed version of Tableau. I am sure you are anxious to create some fascinating visualizations. So let\\'s get started.\\n\\nFirst, we need to learn how to connect Tableau to the data source we will be working with. There are two options: we can either create a connection to a file or a server.  Of course, we\\'ll choose one of the two depending on where the data is located. Let\\'s connect Tableau to a Microsoft Excel file, as an example.\\n\\nEvery time we use a source file in one of the lectures, you will be able to find it in the supplemental resources section. Just open your course curriculum and download the available files for that lesson.\\n\\nOkay, great. I\\'ll select the file called \"GDP data\" under connections. I can now see that Tableau opened the file. Our source has three sheets: \"data,\" \"metadata countries,\" and \"metadata indicators.\"\\n\\nWhat we usually have to do is choose the worksheet we\\'ll need and drag it into the upper part of the screen where \"Drag sheets here\" is written. Once we do that, Tableau will activate the selected sheet and provide us with a preview of the data. The first two rows of the sheet are empty, and hence we see all of these null values. Tableau is really smart and can often help us with similar issues.\\n\\nAs you can see here, the program suggests using its data interpreter functionality to clean the data. All right, let\\'s do that. And voilà! The first two rows containing no values have disappeared. That\\'s awesome.\\n\\nIn our next video, we\\'ll open our first Tableau worksheet, and I\\'ll be happy to introduce you to its structure. This will do for now. Thanks for watching.\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'Section Title': 'Introduction to Tableau', 'Course Title': \"Exploring Tableau's interface\"}, page_content='So we\\'ve already connected our file to Tableau. Now, in this lesson, we\\'ll be creating our first sheet. It\\'s really easy to do and resembles how we create a sheet in Excel or pretty much every other spreadsheet software. All I have to do is click here, and a new sheet will be created.\\n\\nThis is what a Tableau sheet looks like. We can have as many of them as we want. I can simply click on this little icon at the bottom, and a new worksheet is added. The other two icons next to it are for creating a new dashboard and a new story. We\\'ll deal with dashboards further in the course, so we won\\'t use these buttons for now.\\n\\nLet\\'s give some structure to what you are seeing here. If this software is new to you, things can be a bit confusing. So it will be best if we spend a few minutes—the remainder of this lesson—talking you through Tableau\\'s interface.\\n\\nFirst off, we have ten different tabs on Tableau\\'s default ribbon: File, Data, Worksheet, Dashboard, Story, Analysis, Map, Format, Window, and Help. Let\\'s quickly go through each of them.\\n\\nAs with most programs, the File tab contains certain functionalities related to opening, closing, and saving files. If you like, you can also exit Tableau from here.  The Data tab, on the other hand, is where you will find functionalities related to the data source you are using. Here, you can add a new data connection, replace an existing one, or simply edit the data source of the worksheet you are working with.\\n\\nNext, we have the Worksheet tab. It can be helpful when we want to create a new worksheet, hide or show charts, titles, captions, summaries, and so on. I\\'m sure you noticed that we already created a new sheet with the little icon at the bottom left corner of the sheet, and we can do the same thing from the Worksheet tab as well. Such repetition is common for most programs; functionalities available in the ribbon can be accessed in other ways, too. In fact, I rarely use the ribbon functionalities, but it\\'s good to have an overview and be aware that they are there.\\n\\nNext, we have the Dashboard and Story tabs. As I said, we\\'ll learn more about dashboards and stories later in the course. The Analysis tab is where you can tweak your visualization in terms of labels, show figures as a percentage of the total, add trend lines, legends, filters, and more. We\\'ll explore many of these options later in the course; for now, remember that here we have some interesting functionalities related to the way we perform our analysis and some of the tools we\\'ll incorporate in it.\\n\\nThe Map tab is helpful when we use Tableau\\'s geographic visualization capabilities. Pretty soon, you will see that this is one of the most powerful and impressive Tableau features.  Of course, Format can help us adjust the way our visualization appears. From here, we can modify its font, font size, axes, backgrounds, labels, size, and so much more. That\\'s another tab containing plenty of useful functionalities we\\'ll explore later.  Window and Help are two of the standard tabs we find in most programs, so I\\'m not going to spend much time on them, also because we are not going to use them throughout the course.\\n\\nHowever, one thing we should mention is that Tableau Public has a nice and open community of users who will be able to help you and whose work you can look at if needed. All users of Tableau Public who save their work make it publicly available. Therefore, this can be a useful place where you can search for a given issue you need help with and see what comes up. So if I click on Community and search for \"geography,\" I\\'ll be able to see the work other users have saved previously.\\n\\nThis is Tableau\\'s ribbon. Below the ribbon, we have several buttons that can be quite helpful. The \"Show Start Page\" button takes us to the screen we saw previously when we connected Tableau and our GDP data Excel file. To get back to the sheet that was created earlier, I\\'ll click here. I\\'m sure you know how to work with undo and redo. So if I were to drag one of the fields here, I can go back and undo this action with Undo.  Most of the typical Windows shortcuts can be used here as well, as you probably know. The shortcut for undo is Control+Z.\\n\\nOn the right, we have other useful buttons such as Save, allowing you to save the progress of your work.  Quite intuitively, \"New Data Source\" opens the connect functionality we saw earlier. The other buttons we have here are New Worksheet, Clear, Sheet Swap Rows and Columns, Sort, and so on. We\\'ll explore many of these throughout the course; for now, it would be best if you simply gained an idea of how various objects are positioned within Tableau\\'s interface.\\n\\nOn the left side of Tableau\\'s screen, we have two panes: Data and Analytics. The Data pane is quite important. It shows us what data we\\'ve loaded, and then Tableau classifies the data into two types: Dimensions and Measures. To put it slightly differently, this is a distinction between categorical and numerical data. The data in the Dimensions field cannot be aggregated; it is qualitative in nature. Quite the opposite, Measures can be aggregated and are quantitative in nature. In the next few lessons, we\\'ll learn how to work with these fields. But for now, it would be nice if I just showed you that we can drag Dimensions and Measures into the work area and use them to create our visualizations there.\\n\\nThe work area is where we\\'ll create our visualizations, dashboards, and stories, and this is one way to create a chart. I\\'m sure you noticed that the Columns and Rows part of the sheet started showing us the variables we\\'ve added to the workspace area. We\\'ll explore this part of the interface in a separate video in a few lessons.\\n\\nWhat else do we have? The \"Show Me\" button on the right, which allows us to adjust the type of visualization we use. It\\'s a very cool feature because Tableau tells us what types of visualizations we can choose from, as not all charts will be available depending on the data we have chosen to work with. Once we decide we would like to switch to a different chart, all we need to do is select the respective type of chart, and Tableau makes the adjustment for us.\\n\\nAnd finally, here in the middle, we have three important sections: Pages, Filters, and Marks. The Pages shelf lets you break a view into a series of pages, so you can better analyze how a specific field affects the rest of the data in a view. We\\'ll use the Filter shelf when working with filters and filtering our data. The Marks shelf, on the other hand, contains functionalities related to coloring, size, labels, and so on.\\n\\nThis lesson was a quick overview of Tableau\\'s interface. I\\'m sure now you have a better idea of what you see in front of you when you open the program. In the lessons to come, we\\'ll continue to explore Tableau\\'s functionalities, and you\\'ll learn a ton about each of the buttons we mentioned here. As of now, this will do. Thanks for watching.\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'Section Title': 'Introduction to Tableau', 'Course Title': \"Let's create our first chart in Tableau!\"}, page_content='All right, excellent. It\\'s time to continue our adventure in Tableau. In this lesson, we\\'ll create our first visualization, and it\\'s going to be awesome. Let\\'s get right into it.\\n\\nAs you can see, the workspace area is empty right now. We\\'ve already loaded the GDP data file, which you can see here.  Let\\'s open the GDP data XL file for a second to ensure you\\'re familiar with its structure.  It has a few blank rows, but Tableau took care of them.  We have a column with country names, a column indicating this is GDP data, and several columns with GDP figures for each country. This is the data sheet we are using. Perfect.\\n\\nLet\\'s go back to Tableau. The way the data is organized is interesting.  Focus on the dimensions and measures part of the screen. Tableau has intelligently organized our data: categorical variables are under *Dimensions* (in blue), while numerical data (like a country\\'s GDP) is under *Measures* (in green).\\n\\nAnother important point: some fields are italicized, others aren\\'t. Tableau generates some fields based on the data.  For example, the *Measure Names* field wasn\\'t in our original data source, but Tableau created it because it\\'s useful. The same is true for *Latitude*, *Longitude*, *Number of Records*, and *Measure Values* (in green under Measures). The fields without italics are from the XL file: *Country Name*, *Indicator Name*, and the years 2002 to 2016 (containing the countries\\' GDP figures). Good.\\n\\nTableau also adds an icon next to each field under Dimensions and Measures. This helps us understand how Tableau interprets the data. The *Country Name* field has a globe icon; Tableau recognizes it as relating to countries and is ready to help visualize this data. Clicking the icon shows it\\'s a string, and its geographic role is \"Country/Region,\" as expected.  The *Indicator Name* field has a small \"ABC\" icon, indicating a text value. Clicking it confirms it\\'s a string, but its geographic role is \"None,\" as it\\'s purely textual.\\n\\nThe year measures are numerical values.  Clicking their icons confirms they are numbers.\\n\\nLet\\'s drag the *Country Name* field into the workspace area. Boom! Tableau created a world map showing the location of each country in our data source.  Notice that the fields under Columns and Rows aren\\'t *Country Name*, but the automatically generated *Longitude* and *Latitude* fields. This might seem strange at first, but it\\'s intuitive. Tableau understands *Country Name* is geographical; it doesn\\'t just create a list of countries.  It reads the country names and creates *Longitude* and *Latitude* fields to map each country geographically, resulting in the map we see.\\n\\nNow, if I drag the year 2016 onto the map, Tableau updates the chart, adding each country\\'s 2016 GDP.  Hovering over the dots shows the data; for example, the US 2016 GDP was over $18 trillion, while Canada\\'s was around $1.5 trillion.\\n\\nOur first Tableau visualization is almost ready. Let\\'s enlarge the bubbles to better represent GDP size.  Click the tiny arrow on the *Sum of 2016* pane (on the right), select \"Edit Sizes,\" and enlarge the bubbles.  Click \"Apply.\"  This makes GDP comparisons easier.\\n\\nFinally, let\\'s edit the visualization\\'s name. Double-click the title (\"Sheet 1\") and type \"GDP per Country Comparison.\"  And there we have it—our first Tableau visualization! We\\'re just getting started.\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'Section Title': 'Tableau Functionalities', 'Course Title': 'Creating a table'}, page_content='Okay, perfect. In this lesson, we\\'ll continue exploring some of Tableau\\'s main features. In particular, we\\'ll learn how to create a table with data and add some custom fields.\\n\\nThe table we will create will be a simple one, providing a monthly and yearly breakdown of a company\\'s sales. As you can see, our original data source contains a column called \"period.\" This column contains both yearly and monthly data. The first four characters designate the year when a sale was made, and the last two contain information about the month.\\n\\nWhat I\\'d like to do is split this information into two separate custom fields: \"year\" and \"month.\" To do that, go to the Analysis tab and create a calculated field.\\n\\nOnce the dialog box opens, type the name of the field you\\'re creating, which is \"year.\" Then, use the `LEFT` function to take the four leftmost characters of the \"period\" field. This will give us the year when the sale occurred.  The `LEFT` function is familiar to most of you, likely from using it in Excel. It works the same way in Tableau.  We\\'ll explore different types of operations you can use to create custom fields in our next lesson.\\n\\nTableau recognizes that you\\'re writing the `LEFT` function and provides autocomplete suggestions. The `LEFT` function requires two arguments: a string (in this case, the \"period\" field from our source sheet) and the number of characters to extract.  It\\'s important to ensure the \"period\" field\\'s data type is a string; otherwise, Tableau will show an error.  Type \"period,\" and Tableau will recognize and allow you to select the field. The second argument is the number of characters—four in this case. Close the brackets, and your new field is ready. If the \"period\" field wasn\\'t a string, we\\'d have problems because `LEFT` requires strings.  If I change the data type of the \"period\" field, Tableau shows a warning next to the newly generated \"year\" field, and we can\\'t use it. Changing the \"period\" field back to a string resolves the issue. Now, you can easily drag the \"year\" field into the workspace.\\n\\nThe other field I\\'d like to create is \"month.\" To do this, use the `RIGHT` function. Again, go to Analysis and create a calculated field. Name it \"month.\"  Use the `RIGHT` function, following the same procedure as before. The string will be the same \"period\" field, and the number of characters will be two (since the month is represented by the two rightmost characters).\\n\\nNow that we have our \"month\" field, let\\'s add it next to \"year\" in the workspace. You can either drag the field into the workspace and place it next to the \"year\" information or drag the \"month\" field next to the \"year\" field in the rows section; the output is the same.\\n\\nNext, create a new calculated field and name it \"Number of Records.\" In the box below, simply type the number \"1\" and press OK. This field represents a simple count of the rows in our source data.\\n\\nWe\\'ve created a table that groups all 12 months of 2016 and 2017.  Insert the \"Number of Records\" field we just created, and voilà! This table shows the breakdown of the company\\'s total number of sales for each month in 2016 and 2017. Awesome!\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'Section Title': 'Tableau Functionalities', 'Course Title': 'Creating custom fields'}, page_content='We already know how to create custom fields. We did this twice in our previous lesson, creating the \"years\" and \"months\" fields.  In this lesson, we\\'ll explore other ways to transform your source data and create custom fields.\\n\\nRemember, we shouldn\\'t overcomplicate things with extensive data manipulation. Tableau\\'s primary purpose is visualization, not data creation or modeling. However, performing certain manipulations after loading data into Tableau can be very useful for specific analyses.\\n\\nThe typical Tableau operators you\\'ll need are: plus (+) for addition, minus (-) for subtraction, asterisk (*) for multiplication, forward slash (/) for division, and caret (^) for exponentiation.  Alongside these, you\\'ll use comparison operators such as equals (=), greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equal to (>=), and not equals (≠).\\n\\nTableau\\'s logical functions are similar to those in Excel: AND, OR, and NOT.  Many functions and symbols used in Excel also work in Tableau\\'s calculated fields.  Some of the most commonly used functions include: SUM for summation, AVG for average, MIN and MAX for finding minimum and maximum values, and ABS for returning the absolute value of a number.\\n\\nWe\\'ve already seen the text functions LEFT and RIGHT, which extract the leftmost and rightmost characters from a string, respectively.  Besides LEFT and RIGHT, we can also use other typical text functions available in Excel, such as MID (to extract characters from the middle of a string), UPPER (to convert text to uppercase), and LOWER (to convert text to lowercase).\\n\\nThis recap covers the operators and functions used to create custom fields in Tableau.

So, we\\'re ready to return to Tableau and perform a few more operations with the table we created earlier.  It currently shows the number of units sold by the firm in each month of 2016 and 2017. Let\\'s change this measure.  I\\'d like it to show the revenue the company generated during each of these periods. How can we do that?\\n\\nWell, it\\'s quite easy. Our source data includes information about price and the number of units sold. Each row represents a single car sale. Therefore, if we multiply the price field and the number of records field, we\\'ll obtain the revenue. Do you agree? Good. Let\\'s do that.\\n\\nWe already know how to create a calculated field. I\\'ll name it \"Revenue,\" and we\\'ll use Tableau\\'s autocomplete suggestions by multiplying \"Price\" and \"Number of Records.\" As we discussed in the previous lesson, we can use the asterisk (*) operator for multiplication.  You\\'ve probably noticed a useful feature: at the bottom of the screen, Tableau indicates whether the calculation is valid. If I remove a few symbols, Tableau will show an error. This is a helpful guide when creating calculations.\\n\\nSo, this is our \"Revenue\" field. We can easily replace the \"Number of Records\" data in the table with it.  Simply drag the \"Revenue\" field and drop it over the \"Number of Records\" data; Tableau will replace the fields. Perfect.\\n\\nAn important metric in our source data is gross profit. By definition, revenue minus cost of goods sold (COGS) equals gross profit. Currently, we have revenue and gross profit. Let\\'s calculate COGS as the difference between the two. That\\'s easy; we just use the minus operator.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s reorder our table. First, revenue; then COGS; finally, gross profit. We can do this by dragging and dropping the three fields within the table. Note that their values appear in the \"Measure Values\" card on the left. We can change their order from there or directly within the table.  Your choice.\\n\\nOne more thing: you\\'ve probably noticed the \"Measure Names\" field in the Columns section. This is an auto-generated field Tableau uses to structure our table and separate the names of different measures. If we remove it from the Columns section, the table will lose its structure, and all three measures will be combined. Let\\'s press Ctrl+Z to undo that.\\n\\nExcellent.

It's fairly easy to do.\\n\\nI'll go to *Analysis*, then *Totals*, and select *Show Column Grand Totals*. The totals we just added are for the entire period of 2016 and 2017.  However, that's not very useful.  When someone is interested in a company's sales or gross profit, they want to know how much it made in a specific year and whether it performed better than the previous year.

Our table is almost ready; we have revenue, cost of goods sold (COGS), and gross profit.\\n\\nNow, I think we should add a gross margin calculation next to the gross profit figures. Gross margin is helpful because it shows the portion of revenue converted into gross profit after accounting for the cost of goods sold.\\n\\nLet\\'s add a new calculated field. I\\'ll name it \"GM percent.\"  We\\'ll divide gross profit by revenue. We already know how to do that.  Here we are; we\\'ve calculated a new field. Let\\'s add it to the table by inserting it into the Measure Values card.\\n\\nI\\'ve added the new field next to gross profit, but it looks strange, doesn\\'t it?

I get approximately 29%.\\n\\nThere are two possibilities: either Tableau miscalculated the simple division, or our formula is incorrect.

       " Document(metadata={'Section Title': 'Tableau Functionalities', 'Course Title': 'Working with joins in Tableau'}, page_content='One of the most important aspects of your work in Tableau is the data source you are using to perform analysis. Quite often, the data will be stored in multiple locations, and hence you will have to deal with a number of data sources that live in different environments. Nevertheless, you will want to use all of the data available to you and run analysis on everything together.\\n\\nThe way we merge multiple data sources is by using joins. For those of you who have already followed our program and especially our SQL videos, you\\'ll be familiar with what follows in this video. So feel free to skip ahead or continue watching as a refresher.\\n\\nLet\\'s focus on performing cross-data table joins. We want to combine two or more data tables to create a unique database. How do we join separate data tables? Well, there are a few ways to do that: we can create an inner, outer, left, or right join.\\n\\nLet\\'s open an Excel file to better demonstrate what each type of join represents. Here, we have two very simple tables. The first shows the age of three basketball players, and the second shows the salary of basketball players. Please note that the two tables are different due to their last rows. We have LeBron James in the first table and Kyrie Irving in the second.\\n\\nOkay, let\\'s say we would like to run some analysis and use the data available in both tables. Therefore, as described earlier, we have to use joins. But how do we do that? We can easily see that the two tables have one column in common: the \"Basketball Player\" column. This column will serve as a key.\\n\\nWhen we put together the information from both tables, a left join means that the left column of the first table will lead the way. We will use it to create a table containing age and salary information about the three players we see here. Whenever we find one of these players in the right table, we\\'ll add their salary to the new table. As you can see, if their name is not present in the right table (which is the case with LeBron James\\' salary), we will have a null value in the table. If a player\\'s name is not present in the left column of the first table, we will not include any information about them, as this is a left join, and any rows not present in the key field of the left table are omitted in the new table.\\n\\nA right join functions in the same way. However, this time, the left column of the second table leads the way. Kyrie Irving replaces LeBron James, who is not present in the left table. Hence, the only missing value would be Kyrie Irving\\'s age, given that the only information we have about him is in the right table.\\n\\nThe case when we are interested in the intersection of the two tables only is called an inner join. This is when we create a table that contains rows where we have an exact match between the key fields we are joining the two tables with—in our case, \"Basketball Player.\" This time, the newly created table contains only two rows, as both tables contain information about these players. Hence, this is an inner join.\\n\\nAn outer join would be the opposite case: we add all rows of the two tables, regardless of whether there is a match in the key field we are linking with. When there isn\\'t a match, we would have null values, which is the case with both LeBron James and Kyrie Irving.\\n\\nThese are the main principles you need to understand when deciding whether to create a left, right, inner, or outer join in Tableau, depending on your needs and the specific case you are working on. You will then be able to apply one of these structures and join your data.\\n'),\n",

If we manage to do that, we'll be able to create several different charts in Tableau that would allow us to learn if the number of reviews the company receives has been growing; how the average review score changed over time; what the percentage breakdown is between 10-star, 9-star, 8-star, and other types of reviews; what percentage of people acquiring an audiobook leave a review; and visualize the correlation between audiobook sales and the number of reviews, or perhaps visualize the correlation between average review score and sales.\\n\\nIn the lessons to come, you'll see how to do all of that.

The second chart will be a pie chart showing the percentage of reviews each audiobook received. For example, 50% for audiobook 1, 25% for audiobook 2, 10% for audiobook 3, and so on. Finally, the third chart will display the ratio between reviews left and the number of audiobook purchases.

       " Document(metadata={'Section Title': 'The Tableau Exercise', 'Course Title': 'Using Joins in Tableau'}, page_content='As usual, the first thing we need to do when starting a new project is load our data. Our two source files are audiobook reviews and audiobook sales. Let\\'s connect them to Tableau.  Here are the audiobook reviews and audiobook sales files, located in the same folder. We\\'ll need both.\\n\\nTo combine the information from both tables, we\\'ll need to join them.  First, double-click the audiobook sales gray button. Then, drag the audiobook reviews table from the sheets field on the left. We\\'ve just created the join.  Our goal is a unique table containing information about all transactions for all audiobooks and their respective reviews. The transaction ID column is the perfect link between the two files, as it\\'s available in both and can serve as a common field.\\n\\nOne of the main aspects we\\'ll explore in this lesson is how to create a connection between two tables in Tableau.  Remember that we\\'ll distinguish between \"data connection\" and \"table connection.\" A table connection, performed by joining or blending, combines data from two or more data sources. A data connection, on the other hand, represents a single data source connection between Tableau and a data source (like an Excel workbook or SQL database).\\n\\nWhen we imported the second file, Tableau created a connection between the two. The symbol indicates we\\'ve created an inner join. Technically, when creating a join, Tableau sends a query to the database; the join is implemented at the database level, and the output is brought back to Tableau for analysis. An inner join combines tables with a common field.\\n\\nTableau initially created an inner join using the \"audiobook name\" parameter, but we need to link the tables using the \"transaction ID\" parameter, as our analysis focuses on user sales and reviews.  Clicking the inner join symbol opens the join menu. Let\\'s substitute the field.  I\\'ll select \"transaction ID\" to create the connection.\\n\\nHere\\'s a preview of the table created through an inner join using transaction ID as the primary key. An inner join considers only the intersection—where the primary key is found in both tables. For example, if a person with a given transaction ID purchased a course but didn\\'t leave a review, they won\\'t be included.  An inner join requires users to have both purchased a course and left a rating, with both purchase and rating dates known.  It only contains rows with a transaction ID, purchase date, review date, review rating, and audiobook information.  Cases where a person bought an audiobook but didn\\'t rate it are excluded.\\n\\nDo you think this information is important? Do we want to understand how reviews impacted sales and whether we can see a pattern in total purchases with respect to reviews?  Of course!  But an inner join won\\'t provide this information.  Therefore, we need a different type of join—one that includes information about purchases even if no review was left.\\n\\nLooking at the diagram, I\\'ll select a left join, given that the audiobook sales file is on the left. We want a table containing information about *all* audiobook purchases, including cases where buyers didn\\'t provide a rating. A left join is more suitable than an inner join in this case.\\n\\nIn our next lesson, we\\'ll check the data\\'s accuracy in Tableau.  This will do for now.\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'Section Title': 'The Tableau Exercise', 'Course Title': 'Performing a Numbers Check - Attempt #1'}, page_content='Right. Our pace is excellent. In this lesson, we\\'ll verify that the data loaded through our join accurately reflects the figures in the two source files. Let\\'s open Sheet 1 and perform a few checks.\\n\\nFirst, let\\'s determine the total number of sales transactions. We\\'ll drag the \"Number of Records\" field into the workspace. Tableau quickly shows us 110,570 rows with transaction ID information—representing all audiobook sales during the analysis period.  A quick check of the sales Excel file confirms this number.\\n\\nNext, let\\'s change the format of the \"Date of Purchase\" field to \"Date.\" I prefer it among the dimensions fields, with a calendar icon indicating its date type.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s check the number of ratings from the reviews file.  Dragging the \"Ratings\" field into the workspace initially yields 96,897, which is too high. This is because we\\'re summing, not counting, the ratings.  Correcting this to count the ratings gives us 10,798. Let\\'s verify this number as well.  Yes, that\\'s correct.\\n\\nOne final check: Let\\'s add the \"Date of Purchase\" field to the columns and increase the data granularity to a monthly breakdown. This is a simple yet powerful Tableau feature.\\n\\nGranularity refers to the level of detail in a data field. In our example, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly breakdowns represent different levels of granularity for the \"Date of Purchase\" field.\\n\\nHere\\'s the monthly breakdown of reviews. Wait, something\\'s strange. According to Tableau, we received no reviews in December 2017, but I know we did.  Our Excel file proves it.\\n\\nWhat happened? Tableau can be easily confused when joining data and using dimensions like \"Purchase Date\" from the sales file and \"Rating\" from the reviews file.  The date fields from the two joined tables don\\'t seem to match correctly.\\n\\nWhenever you encounter such issues, it\\'s best to use data blending as an alternative to Tableau joins. We\\'ll cover this in our next lesson.\\n\\nThanks for watching.\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'Section Title': 'The Tableau Exercise', 'Course Title': 'Blending Data in Tableau'}, page_content='Data blending is a method of combining data that supplements a table of data from one data source with columns of data from another data source. In our case, we would combine the sales data from the audiobook sales file with the ratings column from the audiobook reviews file.\\n\\nHow does blending differ from joining? You can think of a data blend as a specific type of left join that is preferable or necessary, depending on various conditions. Sometimes, using a join will do a perfect job, while in other situations, blending will either deliver better or quicker results or be the only solution.  Moreover, joining data is something you do manually, whereas data blending is a functionality that Tableau implements automatically while you are working on your sheet. This makes it a more intuitive feature to use, provided that the following conditions are met: both data tables are separate data sources, and there is a field that serves as the connection between them, allowing us to carry out queries that leverage information from both tables. So, one of the preliminary basic requirements to blend data in Tableau is to have a common field creating the connection between the two data tables.\\n\\nFrom a technical perspective, what blending does is take separate query results from each data source and aggregate them in the Tableau view. Only then will it connect and join the query results on the same common field, which should contain information of the same data type. This is different from the case when you are using a join, where the aggregation is happening at the database level, and just the output of the join is being brought back to Tableau. When blending, the aggregation occurs in Tableau.\\n\\nSo what are the benefits of blending data? It turns out that joining or blending can bring different results.  And here is the tricky part: if you join two data tables containing duplicate values that are not aggregated properly during preliminary data work, you will obtain an artificially inflated data set.  Blending solves that problem automatically; Tableau will consider the level of granularity you have chosen in the view (in other words, in your sheet) and will combine the data sources with aggregated fields directly.\\n\\nI think we are ready to create an actual blend in Tableau. Let\\'s open the audiobook sales file first. Then, once I\\'ve opened the file, I\\'ll open a sheet and click on \"New Data Source\" from the Data tab. This is how we will create a new data connection and load both files at the same time without creating a join.\\n\\nAs we can see here, both files are open in Tableau. To make sure we\\'ve created a blend, I can open the \"Edit Relationships\" dialog box and see whether Tableau has created a connection between the two files. In our case, things are pretty straightforward because Tableau immediately recognized that the two files contain columns with the same name, \"Transaction ID.\" The primary data source is the audiobook sales file, which is excellent. This means it would represent the left table of the left join performed while blending the data in Tableau. Alternatively, the view will use all rows from the audiobook sales; the audiobook review instead acts as a secondary data source, the right table. Therefore, while blending, Tableau will use the aggregated rows from this data source based on the dimension of the common fields.\\n\\nFor the sake of exercise, let\\'s select the \"Custom Relationship\" radio button and choose not one but two different fields that serve as the connection between the two files. This is similar to having a two-column primary key and a two-column foreign key in SQL. I\\'ll click on \"Add\" and then would like to connect the \"Date of Review\" and the \"Date of Purchase.\" Hmm, I can\\'t see the \"Date of Purchase\" in here. What is the reason? Well, Tableau didn\\'t recognize that this is a dimension and added this field among measures. Let\\'s change its data type and open the \"Edit Relationships\" window and select to add a new custom relationship which connects the two files based on the \"Date of Purchase\" and \"Date of Review.\" And that\\'s how we edit the relationship Tableau created.\\n\\nLet\\'s switch back to the automatic connection Tableau created. In our next video, we\\'ll test whether blending solved the problem we experienced earlier. Hopefully, we will be able to combine sales and reviews without any problems. Stay tuned.\\n'),\n",

The number of sales transactions is as expected.\\n\\nNext, I\\'ll remove this field and open the audiobook reviews data to check the number of ratings. I\\'ll simply drag and drop the \"Rating\" field. But this time, Tableau displays an error. It tells us that fields cannot be used from the audiobook reviews data source because there is no relationship to the primary data source. We find out our data is not yet blended. To do that, we have to click on the tiny link icon next to \"Transaction ID\" and choose this to be our linking field. The error we observed previously will no longer appear because our two data sources are now properly linked. Great! This is a field that shouldn\\'t be summed but counted, as we are interested in the number of ratings left by students, not the total sum of their ratings. 10,798. Again, the number we expected. It\\'s time for the true test. These numbers were okay last time, too. Remember? Let\\'s plot the number of reviews and the \"Date of Purchase\" field from the audiobook sales file. All I have to do is add \"Date of Purchase\" to the Columns shelf and then choose a monthly breakdown instead of an annual breakdown.\\n\\nOh, no, December 2017 is empty again. What can we do now? Blending doesn\\'t work either. Let\\'s have some faith; we\\'ll figure it out. I\\'ll go to Data and open the \"Edit Relationships\" menu. Here, we can choose the primary data source, which should be \"Audiobook Sales,\" and the fields that serve as a link between the two files. Let\\'s opt for a custom selection and add the following fields: First, I\\'ll link the \"Year of Review Date\" with the \"Year of Purchase Date,\" and the \"Month of Review Date\" with the \"Month of Purchase Date.\" Once we are ready, we can click \"OK\" and see if the situation has changed. Checking the count of the number of reviews with respect to the purchase date will show us whether we\\'ve managed to solve the problem by using different linking fields, and it appears that we have. Here\\'s a timeline that shows the number of ratings left each month. We have 653 reviews for December, not zero. And that\\'s excellent! Wow.\\n\\nIt took us a while, but we figured it out. We had to edit relationships and adjust the field that serves as a link between the two files. Otherwise, we would have been left with a wrong graph, which would be unacceptable in a professional environment, as wrong visualizations lead to wrong business insights. In our next lesson, we\\'ll create the first chart for our dashboard. Thanks for watching.\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'Section Title': 'The Tableau Exercise', 'Course Title': 'First chart'}, page_content='Okay, excellent. We are ready to start with the first chart that will be inserted into our dashboard. Therefore, I\\'ll rename the worksheet to \"Chart 1.\"\\n\\nLet\\'s add the \"Date of Review\" information to the Columns shelf. This is where we\\'ll be able to see the timing of purchases and reviews. As usual, we are interested in a breakdown by month. So I\\'ll select \"Month.\" The workspace area shows us that review dates range from February 2017 to February 2018, which is what we expected.\\n\\nLet\\'s insert some data. I\\'ll add the number of ratings using the COUNT function. Everything\\'s fine, and we have data for December 2017, so we can forget about that problem.\\n\\nAccording to our initial plan, this will be a chart showing the number of reviews and the average review score per month, displayed on a secondary axis. So I\\'ll add the \"Rating\" field to the Rows shelf a second time. But this time, we want the average of these numbers, and we\\'d like to create a dual axis. Excellent.\\n\\nObviously, we will have to fine-tune the axis scale.  Right now, the chart doesn\\'t show a good match. I\\'ll simply double-click and choose a fixed range starting from eight and going all the way up to 10, which is the maximum review score we can have.\\n\\nHowever, right now, the two charts overlap strangely, and we are unable to see their trends clearly. So I\\'ll increase the size of the axis to 12 and change the color of both variables: \"Number of Ratings\" and \"Average Ratings.\" That\\'s easy to do. I need to select one of the two variables and then click on the \"Color\" button under \"Marks.\" Once we\\'ve opened the \"Edit Colors\" menu, we can choose colors we like better. I like yellow and blue. Awesome.\\n\\nI\\'m not a fan of opacity, which adds a transparency effect and sort of mixes the colors in our chart. Therefore, I\\'ll opt for 100% opacity for both variables. See, the chart looks nicer.\\n\\nLet\\'s edit its axes again. That\\'s easy. We have to double-click on a specific axis and type the axis title we want. I\\'ll change \"Counter Rating\" to \"Number of Ratings,\" and \"Month of Review Date\" to \"Month.\" I believe \"Average Rating\" doesn\\'t need to be changed.\\n\\nVery good. This is our first chart. Does it give us any meaningful information? Well, yes, I believe it does. First, we can see that the number of reviews left by people has been increasing, which is great. The average review score is almost nine and sometimes even higher, which is a pretty high score but should be interpreted in comparison with the rest of the market. Moreover, we don\\'t see a dependence between the number of reviews and average ratings, which means that average review scores are not influenced by the number of people leaving reviews. All of this is quite interesting.\\n\\nLet\\'s continue this work in our next lesson when we will create the second chart for our dashboard. Thanks for watching.\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'Section Title': 'The Tableau Exercise', 'Course Title': 'Second chart'}, page_content='Hi, and welcome back to this video. We\\'ll create the second chart, which will be part of our dashboard: a pie chart showing the percentage of total reviews that each audiobook obtained.  The number of reviews is quite important in the marketplace we are studying; this is why we\\'re interested in finding out which audiobooks collected the most reviews. An alternative visualization would be a pie chart showing the percentage of people who purchased a given audiobook. Okay.\\n\\nGiven that we know what we\\'d like to accomplish, things should be easier, right? I\\'ll add the rating field to the workspace area. The number we obtain is the sum of all ratings. Let\\'s use \"count\" for this measure. Perfect. The total number of reviews is 10,798. And we know for a fact that that is true.\\n\\nLet\\'s go ahead and add the audiobook names dimension above the rating field. This creates a breakdown by audiobook—exactly what we want. Now, I can simply select the pie chart icon within the \"Show Me\" functionality, and I\\'ll create a pie chart. It\\'s a really tiny one, but still a pie chart! To increase the chart\\'s size, I can simply click anywhere in the workspace area, hold the Control key, and then use the arrow keys. If I press Control and the up arrow, the chart grows vertically; Control and the right arrow increases the chart\\'s size horizontally. The opposite is also true. We can decrease the chart\\'s size by pressing Control and the down arrow or Control and the left arrow. Awesome.\\n\\nWhat else do we need? Labels, right? Otherwise, it\\'s difficult to gain an idea of what portion of overall reviews a specific audiobook accounted for. I\\'ll drag the rating field into the label, and the number of reviews appears next to each audiobook. Again, we need the count of ratings, and not the sum. Okay. But how do we display these as a percentage? That\\'s not that difficult. Actually, all I have to do is go to Analysis, select \"Percentage Of,\" and then click on \"Table.\" Boom! Here we are.\\n\\nThese are the percentages each audiobook accounted for among the total number of reviews. The pie chart and the labels we added show us that Audiobooks 1 and 2 accounted for more than 50% of the total number of reviews the company received. Very interesting. The business relies greatly on these bestsellers.\\n\\nIn our next lesson, we\\'ll create the third and final chart that will allow us to complete our initial plan and obtain the dashboard we intended from the very beginning.\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'Section Title': 'The Tableau Exercise', 'Course Title': 'Third Chart'}, page_content='Okay, we\\'re almost ready for chart number three. I hope you are too.  Here we go!\\n\\nIn this lesson, we\\'ll create a chart showing the ratio between customer reviews and the number of audiobook purchases in a given month. This is an important KPI, showing us whether people who buy audiobooks are leaving reviews. To do this, we\\'ll need to create a few calculated fields.\\n\\nFirst, let\\'s create a field that counts the number of ratings—not the sum, but the count.  It\\'ll be easier to use this field going forward. We\\'ll name this field \"Number of Ratings,\" and we\\'ll simply use the COUNT function.\\n\\nNext, we\\'ll create a calculated field called \"Number of Purchases.\" Let\\'s change the data source to \"Audiobook Sales.\" This field will contain the number of audiobook sales the company made.  How do we count purchases? Well, the transaction ID is unique, so counting those will give us the number of sales transactions—exactly what we need.\\n\\nGood. Now we can create the final calculated field: the ratio between reviews and new purchases. This is easy since we\\'ve already created the \"Number of Ratings\" and \"Number of Purchases\" fields. We just divide the two, and we\\'ll have the measure we want to plot.\\n\\nLet\\'s add this ratio to the rows of our visualization. The result is a nice bar chart (though a bit large), which is quite meaningful.  It shows that the ratio of ratings to new purchases was significantly lower in November 2017 and much higher the month before—three times higher, to be precise. I\\'m sure the firm\\'s business intelligence team would want to investigate the reason for this discrepancy.\\n\\nLet\\'s quickly edit the horizontal axis title to \"Month\" and save our work. In our next lesson, we\\'ll organize these charts into a dashboard. Stay tuned, and thanks for watching!\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'Section Title': 'The Tableau Exercise', 'Course Title': 'Creating and Formatting a Dashboard'}, page_content='Congratulations on making it this far in our Tableau training! Let\\'s take a moment to review what we\\'ve covered. We began by exploring how Tableau aids corporate decision-making and learned to install Tableau Public.  We then connected data to Tableau, familiarized ourselves with the interface, and created our first Tableau chart.  We also learned to duplicate sheets, create tables, and build custom fields to easily manipulate data.  Furthermore, we added totals and subtotals to tables, worked with filters, and explored functionalities for working with multiple data sources, such as joins and data blending.  Most recently, we created three meaningful charts.\\n\\nNow, we\\'ll build our dashboard—the final piece of the puzzle. It will be insightful to see these three charts together and analyze them simultaneously.  Let\\'s create a new dashboard. I\\'ll click on the tiny icon that displays \"New Dashboard\" when hovered over.\\n\\nOnce the dashboard is created, I\\'ll adjust its size. It\\'s currently too small. I\\'ll modify the settings on the left to make it 1000 pixels wide and 800 pixels high. I hope you\\'re viewing this on a large screen!\\n\\nNow, let\\'s drag and drop the three charts. Tableau intelligently manages space and anticipates our actions as we position the cursor.  However, some adjustments are needed. I\\'ll remove the legends; we only need the audiobook legend, and I\\'ll place it below the pie chart for clarity.  I\\'ll simply drag the legend to its new position.  Let\\'s resize it slightly to remove any overlapping arrows.\\n\\nTo remove the pie chart\\'s arrows and ensure a proper fit, we\\'ll adjust its size.  I\\'ll slightly reduce the pie chart\\'s size horizontally and vertically in the chart editor, then return to the dashboard to see the result.  Great, the arrows are gone!\\n\\nNext, let\\'s improve the chart titles; they\\'re currently not very descriptive.  A better title for the first chart would be \"Number of Reviews and Average Rating.\" I\\'ll set the font size to 11 and bold the text.  We\\'ll do the same for the other charts for consistency.  The pie chart\\'s title will be \"Number of Reviews by Audiobook,\" and the third chart\\'s title will be \"Ratio of Reviews to Sales.\"\\n\\nOur dashboard is nearly complete. In the next lesson, I\\'ll show you how to add a filter, transforming this into a truly interactive tool that allows for deeper analysis and simultaneous filtering of all three charts.\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'Section Title': 'The Tableau Exercise', 'Course Title': 'Adding Interactive Filters for Improved Analysis'}, page_content='Okay, guys, we\\'re almost there!  Our goal in this lesson is to add a filter to our data, allowing us to select specific audiobooks for analysis directly from the dashboard. Sounds useful, right?\\n\\nThe data we see is meaningful and shows important trends. However, actionable decisions will likely need to be made at the individual audiobook level, addressing the specific performance of each audiobook our firm sells.\\n\\nAll right, let\\'s add a filter to chart number two, the pie chart. I\\'ll click the small arrow in its upper right corner (containing more options) and apply \"Audiobook Name\" as a filter. We\\'ll need to adjust the charts\\' size and position on the dashboard slightly to improve the arrow\\'s visibility. I think this will do.\\n\\nNow, when I use the filter, changes only affect the pie chart; the other two charts remain unchanged because the filter doesn\\'t currently affect them.  We want this filter to modify the entire dashboard, not just one chart. How do we do that?\\n\\nLet\\'s select the small arrow in the filter\\'s upper right corner and choose \"Apply to Worksheets.\" In the dialog box, we can select chart one and chart three, then press \"OK.\"\\n\\nHopefully, the filter now affects all three charts.  And yes, it does!  However, something seems odd. When I unfilter the first few audiobooks, the ratio of reviews to sales continues to decrease—which doesn\\'t make sense.  It appears the ratios are calculated relative to the total number of audiobooks. That\\'s strange. Let\\'s check.\\n\\nI suspect a problem with the other two charts.  Looking closer, I see the blending connection for the \"Audiobook Name\" field hasn\\'t been activated. Let\\'s activate the connection for both charts and see if that changes things.\\n\\nNow, when I unfilter the first few audiobooks, the percentage doesn\\'t decrease; it even goes up. I believe this is correct.\\n\\nRemember: To use chart elements as filters, simply select \"Use as Filter\" in the upper right corner of a chart.  All three charts will then update. This is another way to use filters—filtering directly from the filter or clicking a chart element makes little difference; a filter will be applied in either case.\\n\\nWe\\'ve created a dashboard that can be easily filtered and unfiltered. Now we can explore the relationship between different audiobooks, their number of reviews, average score, and the ratio of reviews to sales. That\\'s awesome! Play around with the data and share your insights. Great job completing this exercise!\\n\\nIt was a pleasure teaching you Tableau, and we hope to see you in our other modules. Until then, a warm hug and thanks for watching!\\n'),\n",
